Bellroy’s return policy,"So I got one of their lite mini slings due to the sale. After receiving it, I regretted that I got it in this chalk color, as it seems easy to get stained and hard to clean. I asked for an exchange for the black color. They asked for photos to verify that it’s unused and is in that “resaleable” condition. I sent them over, got rejected because apparently it’s already dirty and used by their definition. I thought that they must’ve made a mistake. So I sent another email under different lighting, literally used a high cri flashlight. Same thing, the new email pointed out another apparently stained/used area.

It just felt like they’re making excuses to accept returns, and hoping you would suck it up and buy another one with a slight discount.

Anyways, take this as my rant. And a warning for future potential buyers that may find this through a google search.

","[""Really sorry you're going through this, nightmare.\n\nThere are so many accounts of Bellroy customer service being terrible, I would never buy directly from them.\n\nI would be very careful keeping any of their bags - they offer only a three year warranty, so they don't appear to have much faith in the longevity of their products. Combine that with bad customer service, is it likely you would get good support when something goes wrong? I feel it's unlikely! \n\nIf they won't help you, an option would be chargeback/ transaction dispute on your payment method (unless it was kept in a Bellroy wallet that has stretched and it's fallen out). Your bank is likely to back you up but Bellroy will probably not sell directly to you again. (But as above, I'm not convinced that's a big loss and you can always buy via a third party in future if you decide to.)"", 'Must say that these are terrible examples of customer service. Also the uneven stichting doesn’t inspire confidence.\n\nCant you return it because of the bad quality / easy staining?

And what bothers me actually is that the stitches on the sides of that tab in the marked area are not even."", 'This confirms to me that their products are ultimately not worth buying. I see so many bag/sling/pack reviewers on YouTube that get a hard on for anything Bellroy and never seem to give a true honest review. \n\nIf your customer service is like this - I’m good.', ""I've stopped buying bellroy products a long time ago. Their V1 products like the classic backpack plus works great up until today, but their newer products aren't as durable as it used to be. Sorry to hear about that, OP.

I love the look of their items but the CS and quality is dodgy af.', 'Wow never buying from Bellroy then. I feel like shitty customer service is an easy way to get cancelled. If you can’t stand by your product, why should your customers? Ugh', 'Yikes, that’s BAD. Yea their customer service is pretty sketchy. When you make a warranty claim, they ask you to describe your typical loadout.

[Here\'s a pic](https://imgur.com/a/IhOopSk).\n* Their advice was to let it break in over time... but also that returns were only for unused items.

The description said 1.5L but it is noticeably smaller than my gf’s 1L Lululemon belt bag. It also had a funky pocket on the inside that is basically useless.

Bellroy Premium Wallet Review after owning a previous Bellroy for a decade!,,"['My dad bought me a $20 leather wallet from the brand “Structure” at a department store in 2012. I was 24 years old, about to start my first big boy job, and the wallet has treated me so well over the years. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I think pretty much any good quality leather wallet can be a BIFL.\n\nThe funny thing about this wallet is that a guy in a cafe in rural Taiwan offered to buy it off me last year. First he offered $40, then $80, then $120, then $160. Of course I wouldn’t sell, this thing has been with me for *ten years.*\n\nAfter he gave up, he asked what price I *would have* sold for. I just couldn’t come up with a number. All I could tell him was “not $160.” After ten years, you can get really attached to things.', '[deleted]', 'Will never buy another brand again my friend! My zipper wallet will outlast me probably.', ""I had a Bellroy hide and seek for 10 years and loved it.....until my new rescue decided to undo that hard earned patina. As a result, Bellroy's quality always impressed me and, after reading conflicting reviews, decided to go with a premium version of the hide and seek and wanted to share my thoughts on how they compare, what alternatives I considered, and if the new H&S is BIFL.\n\nLooking past the bite marks of the old H&S, the patina that developed was wonderful. Every stitch still in tact, been through several wash cycles, after beaten to hell, the wallet was better a decade in than the day I bought it. Honestly, best wallet I have owned barring that owl accent that poked my butt. Other than applying lexol cleaner/conditioner once or twice a year, I am convinced that wallet would be BIFL.\n\nWas never intending on buying another wallet and decided to do additional research on the market to find another BIFL product. I was considering many brands, from saddleback/tanner to local leather workers, but went back to what I knew.... Bellroy. I was reading conflicting reviews on their quality in 2022, little to no discussion on their premium leathers, and decided on the premium hide and seek for several reasons:\n\n* Premium version does not have the owl to poke my butt\n* I really like the dual tone of the premium versions\n* The ECCO leather interested me from a quality standpoint\n* Wanted a slim bi-fold with a low to medium capacity\n* Cash needs to lay flat\n\nInitial impressions of the Premium H&S, holy crap what an upgrade. The leather is incredible. It feels so buttery soft to the touch and cannot wait to see how it develops. The stitching appears really robust, the inner lining seems more rugged. With all that increased ruggedness, the wallet is just as thin as my previous Bellroy. Toss in quality of life changes, RFID protection, we have a winner.\n\nAlthough I am genuinely sad my previous H&S is no longer in my EDC, I am proud to say Bellroy makes a quality product that will last a lifetime (as long as I keep it away from my rescue)."", 'My Bellroy wallet is 8 years old and looks brand new still. Wonderful company with wonderful products.', ""I also have a Bellroy wallet (I think a note slim, but designs have changed over the years so I could be wrong).

Walked into their store, they had the exact same wallet still for sale, and I remarked to the cashier that I'd like one, as the one I'm replacing is older than her.

Bellroy - Are they worth the money?,"The more I look into their bags, the more it makes me wonder *what makes them so expensive?* Specifically, I've been looking at their Transit Workpack 20L, priced at $200. And, don't get me wrong, they look great. But from the reviews, I don't understand what makes them more expensive than, say, the Aer City Pack at $150. The biggest thing that surprised me was that Bellroy didn't offer lifetime warranty, which seemed to be the trend for a lot of these brands that are at this price range.

So, is there something I'm missing about them?

Got one for 60 and could then barely stomach the price. \n\nGot a used venture sling 4L for 30 and was ok with that. No way that is a 100 sling. \n\nInsane prices in my eyes, but quality is ok at discounted prices. \n\nThe warranty and customer service suck, which is why I would only get them if I like them at a discount. \n\nThe bags I have are nice, solid and I haven’t had any issues until now.

The part that digs in, is where the straps connect to the bag at the bottom - plus the edges of the straps down there, including the strap keeper. \n\nOtherwise I find it quite good - it's comfy, I can fit a ton of stuff even in a 20L shell, and it looks stylish and green. \n\nThe water bottle holder using internal space and being hard to access is a bit annoying too, and I don't find a good use for the mesh divider in the main pouch.

And I was shocked to see what I received today.
With only three stitches, and two of them already stated to rip without being used, it is hard to imagine the two tiny webbing straps are attentively designed to endure the weight of a bag with 20L capacity for three years?

Bellroy bags quality / experience,"I’m tempted by the totepack in the ripstop material and the venture duffel. Anyone got these and how do they hold up? They are expensive so want them to last.
I’ve heard a lot of mixed reviews. I recently sent back the totepack in looma weave due to an issue and the cs was decent.","['No direct experience but I tend not to support businesses with overtly shady practices. The fact that Bellroy and Carryology have the same owners and Carryology “reviews” Bellroy’s products and gives Bellroy products annual awards without big disclaimers says all you need to know.', ""I have multiple products from Bellroy for around a year, including Classic Backpack and Lite Sling. The materials and overall build quality are great. The only thing I can complain about are adjustment straps on the backpack — they are really long, especially if you don't carry much.

My opinion is that they almost uniformly look and feel much cheaper than they are. I doubt I would buy one of their products over other established ""bag nerd"" brands on that basis alone. My wife was looking for a bag and some of them stood out in online pictures. The moment she saw one in person and held one she said there was no way it was worth the price, and that they look cheap.\n\nCombine that with their Carryology situation and some stories of bad customer service I\'ve heard, and there\'s just no reason to consider one in my opinion.', 'I had a Venture 22l backpack and overall the build quality was as good as I’ve seen (main comparison are Aer, Yeti, The North Face), the materials were great, it didn’t show much wear with use, and it was a very well designed bag. It did, however, suffer from the well documented strap slippage issue, but their support was good. I found the shoulder straps too wide for me though so I sold it. \n\nI also have a desk caddy tech organiser which has been thrown around for well over a year and still looks brand new. \n\nAnd I have a brown Card Pocket wallet which is wearing nicely after a couple of years of use. \n\nSo mixed results, but I think the fitment of the backpack has put me off trying another, but I’ll gladly continue buying other products.', 'I had the same concern given what I’ve read in this sub about Bellroy, but I tried so many other packs and couldn’t find THE bag for me. Took a chance on the Venture Ready 26L and I’m really impressed so far. \n\nI expect that all brands have standout examples of horrible things happening (I’ve hear it for Aer, Evergoods, Alpaka, and various other “big” brands from this sub) but they’re probably outliers that get a lot of attention because of the nature of social media. \n\nWe don’t often hype our positive experiences and when we do, that feedback is often less salient in our collective memories. \n\nMy suggestion is to order from Amazon if you’re able, get it in hand and decide for yourself if you feel like the quality is there. If not, free return within the window.', 'They only give a 3 year warranty.  I think that answers your question.', 'only have venture sling 9L, but doesn’t seem worth the price. It doesn’t feel anywhere near 9L (in a bad way…more like 5L) and quality of materials is a bit suspect. Initially felt very high quality but  e.g. glued rubber lettering fell off within a month. Design seems great at first too but little annoyances creep in (as with anything i spose).

I can barely get the straps over my shoulders, I’m concerned it’s a manufacturing defect, shorter than normal backpack straps? It’s odd and it is not comfortable.', 'I have the venture sling 9L and find it not only carries what I need but keeps everything organized. The keyring is a nice touch, it allows quick and easy access to them which is excellent. It wears well in all types of weather, keeping my items dry. which is a plus living in Canada as the winter months roll in. Bonus if you are left handed and carry your sling on the right side you still have quick access due to their double zipper system.', 'I have a bit of Bellroy stuff.

"After using the Bellroy leather case on the Pixel 7 for only 4 months, it is already tearing and peeling and Bellroy support says this is ""not a manufacturing fault"". Be warned about this product.","I bought a Pixel 7 Pro in October and my wife bought a regular Pixel 7. We both decided to splurge on a better case this time around and went with the Bellroy leather cases. These cases are $60 each, so about $120 in total.

After only 4 months of standard, regular use, BOTH of our cases have started to tear and peel at the corners. See images here: [https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ](https://imgur.com/a/rwMNpyQ)

Given this product was $60 and only lasted 4 months, I thought clearly this should be covered by Bellroy and can't be normal damage. I contacted Bellroy, showed them the images, and this is the response they sent me:

&#x200B;

*""Thanks so much for your patience and for confirming. We've reviewed the condition of your phone case from the photo and the area where the leather is peeled wouldn't be considered a manufacturing fault. Our production team has confirmed that this product is a full wrap leather product and unlike previous releases. To be clear, due to the construction of these cases, the leather we are using is thinner than the other cases which makes them less padded and have an increased risk of being damaged by other objects.""*

""*As such, putting the case on a rough surface, dropping them on soft/hard surfaces, or accidentally scratching them to a surface with a sharp object might end up with similar results. Based on the information provided this has been deemed as accidental damage from normal use so we're afraid that this isn't eligible for a warranty replacement.  I understand that this might be disappointing however we hope this doesn't stop you from continuing with us or loving future Bellroy.""*

&#x200B;

I basically got told from Bellroy that their case falling apart in 4 months is because they make it with cheap, thin leather, therefore this kind of wear is expected but it is not a manufacturing fault.....even though they manufactured it cheaply. OK, whatever, that is the first and last time I ever buy a Bellroy product, and I wanted to warn people here as well as see if anyone has had similar experiences with their cases?","["">To be clear, due to the construction of these cases, the leather we are using is thinner than the other cases which makes them less padded and have an increased risk of being damaged by other objects\n\nI like how they flat out admitted that they made them cheaper than previous generations.

Bellroy Chimera Sling,"**first impressions:** 

this is an improved version of the regular 6L venture sling.

bellroy didn't go into specifics but on carryology website they say this still is 6L but with added volume (now I can fit my Nintendo Switch with a thick case and have spare space for more stuff).

the improved strap now has a handle and metal buckles, it is super easy to grab from any side or hang on a hook. 

they also fix the problem with the pen holder, which on the regular version was way too small to fit any pen.

Title: Disappointed with Bellroy's Warranty Policy - Tokyo Tote Bag Zip Issue,"
Hey everyone ,

I wanted to share my recent experience with Bellroy regarding the warranty coverage on their products, specifically the Tokyo Tote bag. Unfortunately, I've encountered an issue with the zipper, and despite my belief that it falls within the warranty, Bellroy has declined coverage with the below correspondence. 

Thanks for the information, Nissanka

Please be advised that our 3-year warranty covers faults in materials and workmanship and doesn't apply if the damage is caused by unreasonable use or neglect, normal wear, and tear, or if you change your mind.

Based on the information provided, the zipper was broken since the bag fell towards the top (zipper first) the items inside the bag might have caused the zipper breakage. Having said that this is part of accidental damage which is not covered by the warranty. 

We regret that we are unable to process a replacement at this time. 

I believe the bag has failed as a result of a poor choice of zip which can’t handle the rigours of travel. This wasn’t a result of neglect or poor use. These bags are not cheap so I expect better warranty especially when I have had better experience with other brands which covered thier product without a lot of question. 

I used the bag under normal circumstances, and I expected it to be durable enough to withstand everyday wear. The team concluded it was accidental damage not covered by the 3-year warranty. While I appreciate their offer of a 10% discount on a future purchase, I find it disappointing that my Tokyo Tote's issue isn't considered warranty-worthy, especially given its intended use.

Has anyone else faced a similar situation with Bellroy or a different brand? How did you handle it? Considering lodging a complaint with consumer affairs but would love to hear your thoughts and experiences first.

Thanks for listening!","['I’ve been burned by their customer service in the past as well, not on warranty stuff thankfully but on new in box returns. While I like some of my products from them, my anecdotal impression of their customer service has not been awesome. Real shame, and a change from the early days when they were just doing small wallets. \n\nSorry that wasn’t much help, if it were me, I’d maybe take it to a tailor and see if you can get a new zipper installed (throw an  aqua guard on there!)', ""This is a crowded market with more options than ever for backpacks, slings, etc. Poor service and warranty practices are an easy signal to buyers to look elsewhere.\n\nI've browsed Bellroy's lineup many times, but this kind of response is such a turnoff. When a company touts their sustainability practices and recycled materials only to turn around and deny any kind of warranty or repair service, it becomes clear those values are worth little to nothing.\n\nA broken bag like this is very likely to end up in the trash. They'd rather sell you a new item than extend the life of a pack that probably still has 90% or more of its usable life left with a zipper repair.\n\nI've had better customer service experiences from AliExpress  and Temu sellers."", 'Their customer service is the literal worst of any bag company that I’ve dealt with', 'If you were in Australia I would be saying my next stop is the ACCC as that isn’t normal wear and tear.', 'I have never seen a zipper fail in such a way. Looks like a whole series of teeth SHEARED off. Whether this is in your favor is questionable. \n\nThe company could say given the extraordinary mode of the failure, this could only be caused by misuse of their product and therefore not covered by warranty.\n\nOn the other hand, you could claim because the zipper failed in such a rare, spectacular way, this demonstrates a faulty product. \n\nEither way, good luck!', ""Their bags look good but I've never heard anything good about Bellroys warranty or customer service. This plus they're part of Carryology really puts me in a place to have zero desire to support this company."", 'Duly noted. Sorry to hear they didn’t treat you as a valued customer.', '[deleted]', 'This is part of the reason I don’t like Bellroy. I did like their Slings and Tokyo totepack.

I feel like I've read so many bad ones. \n\nEven if their stuff felt nice, I think I wouldn't want one on the basis of all these stories alone."", ""Damn, thanks for sharing and sorry to hear it. This kind of thing is a missed opportunity by companies who decide that instead of gaining a customer for life, they'd rather save ~$30. Seems like a warranty issue to me."", ""Yeah they also wrote me off on warranty too. Shame because luxury brands (Mercedes, Rolex, Burberry) usually go out of their way to give that 'excellent customer expeeience'\n\nGuess Bellroy aren't one of those brands..."", 'Dully noted Bellroy no longer on my recommendation list for family and friends \n\nThanks for the heads up', 'That’s a bummer.  \nI’ve not heard great things about Bellroy quality or customer service so I’ve stayed away from them for the most part. \nI’d be off to the relevant ombudsman to see what they can do for you.', ""Ouch, I was eyeing a bag from them but it appears I should look elsewhere, just seems like a cheap spec for a zipper, have never seen this happen. Even if it's not under warranty I would have thought they can replace it for a nominal fee to cover postage. Definitely go to a tailor to replace it."", ""I'd like to hear the reason why Bellroy opted for a plastic Vision/[Vislon](https://ykkamericas.com/product/vislon/) zipper instead of a standard coil for the Tokyo. [Coil zippers are superior, more flexible for curved seams](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/blogs/componentshc/zippers-an-overview#:~:text=Coil%20zippers%20are%20more%20resilient,the%20size%20that%20you%20want), which is surprise! exactly where the Bellroy's zipper failed.  That's why coils are so widely used in *better* backpacks (as opposed to Vision zips which are popular for jackets, sweaters and fleeces). I'd pass on any bag that had a molded plastic Vision zipper there."", 'I saw posts like this pop up a few years ago when researching a bag and ultimately decided against spending my money with Belroy. \n\nThis post just renewed my feeling this is not a company to deal with. Thanks for reporting the experience.', 'Bellroy just ensured they won’t get a dime of business from me.', 'Bellroy is flaming hot garbage. Their customer service is an absolute joke too. They’ll ignore you and hope you forget about items that are within return and warranty windows. They really need to be investigated by the Better Business Bureau.', ""bellroy is not cheap but if that's their policy , it just makes some of us double think when buying their products.\n\nsome of the less famous brand i bought, even though their business is not big and famous, but they replace zipper no questions asked."", 'I don’t recommend Bellroy just bc of their lack of Warranty and sticking to their own guidelines.', ""But hey, with 10% off, they'll only make 85% margin on your next purchase."", ""That's so disappointing. The bag looks great on their website and I was considering one myself.\n\nI am sorry you got burned by Bellroy. Even if you DID drop the bag like they said you did, I think we can all agree the zipper should not be that fragile.\n\nWhat a shame. A 10% off coupon would be an insult to me. Why would I want to buy another bag if they evidently don't allow for warranty claims?"", 'Tried to pull up a picture of this bag but every picture of the ""Tokyo Tote"" shows a coil zipper. I browsed the Bellroy site and I think what you have is the ""Tokyo Totepack"" or ""Tokyo Totepack Compact"". These bags look like they have Vislon zippers.\n\nVislon teeth are prone to failure like this, they can snap off, but they don\'t just spontaneously do this, and you admittedly dropped the bag with something hard inside crushing the teeth upon impact. This might be an unpopular opinion but I don\'t think this is a \'defect in materials\', and certainly not a \'defect in workmanship\'. Bellroy didn\'t \'make\' this zipper.\n\n*Perhaps* this zipper wasn\'t the ideal choice for this application, and that would lie in design intent. Although I don\'t think Bellroy is at fault here, what they *should* have done was to fix this under warranty or replace it, or at the very least give you a much more substantial credit to offset the cost of repairing this third-party at a tailor.\n\nI\'d replace this with a reverse coil zipper, like they use in the Tokyo Tote.', 'I was planning to purchase the Totepack earlier this year as I really like how it looks and functions. However, I got turned off by their 3-year warranty, so I bought the Aer TP3 Small instead. I hope Aer is better in taking care of their customers than Bellroy.', 'Almost went with Bellroy. Read up on their bad customer service and bogus warranty. Went with Aer instead', ""\\* So update to the communication with Bellroy I replied politely saying I would like to escalate this further to consumer affairs here in Australia to which they replied by saying that although they stand by their warranty and my accidental damage of the zip doesn't come under this that they would process a one-time courtesy exception and send a new bag out. I'm happy that this is the result but I wish I didn't have the back and forth and the need to say I'll go to consumer affairs. As many of you mentioned brands that make the returns and claims process easy and simple make the brand experience a lot better. It has made me look at their brand differently, unfortunately. I appreciate everyone's advice and comments on this post, i mean who knows maybe they caught wind of it :). Hopefully, my second time with the bag will be smooth i certainly will be more careful with it as a result."", 'I don\'t understand how a zipper could be broken in such a way due to ""misuse"" while nothing else suffered any sort of damage, like the seams, which would make a bit more sense IMO. This seems like very poor zipper quality.\n\nIf it helps for future purchases, while anecdotal (so take with a grain of salt), I\'ve had very good experiences with Alpaka\'s customer support. I got a Bravo Sling Max V1 replaced for a faulty waterproof zipper that had come slightly peeled off and while I notified them like a year and a half after the purchase (because I initially didn\'t bother to make a claim but later it became a bit difficult to zip/unzip it) and they instantly sent me a replacement (a V2 version even).\n\nI just got their Elements Backpack Pro and it came with a slightly deformed back panel and, mostly due to being tired and annoyed due to an issue with the customs declaration, I sent them an email about it. They offered me a replacement bag, but ultimately I decided to have it on ""trial"", since it should go back to normal with regular use, and get back to them if I end up needing the replacement.\n\nOverall their qualities are good, and at the very least, they use YKK zippers, so you shouldn\'t encounter this problem ;).\n\nTheir main issue is packaging. They just wrap their stuff in packaging plastic and call it a day (which is why my backpack came deformed). In my latest emails with them they told me they would introduce the option of delivering it in a box if the customer wants to, but let\'s see if and how they implement it.', 'Wuh I was just gonna splurge on them. Am taking my business elsewhere. Thanks for sharing! will forward this to my friends as well for heads up', 'I like their bags but have only heard negative things about their service and warranty. For the amount they charge, I decided against buying from them because of the negative reputation', ""I happen to be in the slightly awkward position of thinking Bellroy's customer service is utterly abysmal and yet owning a lot of their bags. \n\nWhy? Because they're designed well. The Apex is insanely comfy. \n\nHowever, there are very few companies that have any good service regarding zips. Goruck doesn't even cover zips last I heard.\n\nIt's frustrating because they're the part of the bag most likely to break but that's likely why they're not covered. \n\nI should point out my gf uses her Tokyo totepack for everything, including light hiking and somehow it's held up."", 'That’s honestly disheartening to hear. That looks like some serious damage to the zippers but I am not knowledgeable enough to determine fault. \n\nAlthough I will say I did have good service when submitting a warranty claim for their backpack. My damage was very minor compared to what you have (frayed stitching on shoulder pads). Bellroy sent me a replacement after a few photos sent.', ""Bellroy's warranty is border line fraudulent as it is applied.

I made a post on my experience on Reddit also.', ""None of their newer bags are durable at all(or rather as durable as their older bags) now they're a mainstream brand. I've had to return the transit work pack, venture ready bag, and the bellroy tech briefcase because of one issue or another. I now regret passing off my Shift backpack to a family member. The newer venture backpacks just doesn't cut it, and the apex is too expensive. I guess I'm sticking to my version 1 classic backpack plus until it breaks. Then I'll move on to another brand. The old bellroy was better."", ""Sorry to hear a company fail to do the right thing like that.  They could have had a customer for life, but might have steered your away from their products in the future.  I had a similar experience with a bag fainted with Everki.

Ugh 😩\xa0', ""Oof. Sorry about that experience. You obviously got mistreated. But for a dissenting voice/experience, I'll say that when I found some slightly frayed material on the inside of the side pocket of the Venture Ready 26L that was near the zipper yet nowhere close enough to alter its functioning--or any function of the pack--they pretty much demanded that I immediately send it back to them for a replacement of the entire bag. I really liked their customer service; they were always super attentive and quick when replying to my questions and concerns.

Bellroy Tokyo Laptop 14 or Bellroy Via Work Bag,"Hi guys, 

need to finalize which of the two bags is better, both in comfort and style. I only need to store my 14-inch MacBook pro, wallet, and some small items. So no need for extra bag features. I haven't seen a Bellroy laptop bag in person so I can't really tell if it's that good.

  
**Bellroy Via Work Bag (14L Laptop Messenger Bag) - 129 USD**

16.54 x 5.51 x 12.6 inches; 1.46 Pounds

**Bellroy Tokyo Laptop Bag (Slim 14 Laptop Messenger Bag) - 149 USD**

11.81 x 1.97 x 15.75 inches; 1.04 Pounds

  
I'm leaning towards the Tokyo Laptop 14 because of it's size and weight and it's very compact. But design wise the Work Bag has a Slate Color which has gray accents and I'm also a big fan of the owl logo.

I can't see much video reviews of the Bellroy Tokyo Laptop because it was just recently released.

Thoughts?

","['I was researching both of these as well and wish there were some reviews comparing them. In the end, I couldn’t decide and went with the Tom bihn daylight brief for the packability factor', 'How does the color look in real life?', ""Just bought the via work bag and bellroy definitely overstated its capacity. With my 13' MacBook air, a magazine, a A5 notebook, keys, and other bits and bobs,  the bag already feels pretty uncomfortable on me due to its narrow shoulder strap, so to reduce the weight and wear it more comfortably, I have to remove several items. On top of that, the strap holders are in weird positions as well, making crossbody carry uneasy, because the strap would twist. But apart from the shoulder strap, it is a good bag, and I tend to keep it because I won't walk for more than 30 minutes carrying it.\nEven though I never used the laptop bag, but given the pictures, I think they have made slight changes in the angle of the two small strap holders (same on their Tokyo work bag), which may enhance the comfort of wearing the bag in messenger mode, but these two bags seem to share the same narrow strap pad.\nStill, according to your daily carry items, the laptop bag might be a better choice."", ""Decided to get the Tokyo Laptop 14, I asked Bellroy on Instagram what they thought about it and they said that the Tokyo has better materials compared to the Via Work Bag, and it's much smaller which I like. As for the color I just went with black. I'll give a review on the bag once it arrives."", 'Still waiting for it to arrive.', ""I got the Laptop Bag, yes you are correct on the strap. It's not the best strap and even cheaper bags have wider straps. Although all my items fit perfectly on the bag which is good."", 'Good deal. Yeah I may still grab one of those eventually if I can catch a sale or something', 'Have you had a chance to review it?', ""That is actually quite nice as it meets your demands. And since you don't carry a great deal of weight, the shoulder strap connectors might not rip away as many have experienced on their Tokyo Work Bag."", 'Been using it everytime I work. I like how it looks, leather bellroy accent, material, and zipper. Very compact and fits my laptop, wallet, ballpen, and small notebook. The interior looks classy. It’s a bag for a minimalist.\n\nThe downside is probably the strap, I wish it was wider and had some padding, but you can replace or remove it since it’s attached via carabiners.', ""Thank you! Actually, I don't use the strap, and I'll be using it for my 14-inch MacBook Pro. I'll go ahead and order one.""]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]","['2024-05-06 15:55:41', '2024-05-07 19:11:20', '2024-05-27 19:13:12', '2024-05-06 16:02:20', '2024-05-07 19:44:31', '2024-05-27 20:03:46', '2024-05-06 16:10:27', '2024-06-22 17:20:16', '2024-05-28 08:24:57', '2024-06-22 20:35:49', '2024-06-22 23:51:32']",3,2024-05-06 07:56:06

Bellroy Venture 26L Advice,"Hi everyone, I own a Topo Designs 40L Global Travel bag that I use for 1 week or more trips. But I’m in the market for a smaller bag for overnight to 3-5 day trips. I’ve fallen a little in love with the look of the Bellroy Venture Ready 26L and they have the 1st gen on sale in Navy for $155 (2nd gen is $259 and the only difference is a luggage pass through that I won’t use and an AirTag hidden pocket. I found no other discernible differences in structure size or function). 

For context, I do tend to overpack a bit (but I’m working on it, lol) and mainly only travel to warm weather places. 

A sample of what my current 3-5 day list looks like:

Wear on plane: Patagonia Capilene Cool Daily Tee, Public Rec Flex shorts, Bombas No Show merino socks, Adidas Climacool mesh boxers, Adidas tank undershirt, Ridge Merino Solstice sun hoodie, Kizik Athens, Mission baseball cap. 

Need to pack:

2 Patagonia Capilene Cool Daily tees, 2 Public Rec Go To tee, 1 Public Rec Elevate tee, 1 Public Rec Go To polo shirt. 

1 Public Rec Flex shorts, 1 Patagonia Stretch Wavefarer shorts, 1 Western Rise Evo shorts, 1 Western Rise Evo 2.0 pants, 1 Arctic Cool mesh shorts. The Flex and Wavefarer shorts double as swimsuits, and the mesh shorts would just be pajama/lounge shorts. 

Fairly certain I can get the tops and bottoms in my 11x11 compression packing cube. 

5 Adidas Climacool mesh boxer briefs, 3 Adidas tank undershirts, 3 Bombas No Show merino socks, 2 Mission baseball caps. I always wear a hat and these pack rather easily as they’re unstructured. Also, I wear mesh boxers as a liner while swimming in hybrid shorts so I take more than the number of days. 

The underwear, socks and hats should all fit in my 11x7.5 compression packing cubes. 

So those two cubes stacked on top of one another are 18.5” in height and 11” in width. The Bellroy is 19.6” tall and 13” wide, so should be good there. 

Other things I need to fit in the main bucket compartment would be my Olukai Ohana’s (size 11th pack pretty thin), Matador Refraction Packable Sling (2.5x7x2” would probably go in the clamshell slash pocket), and my 10x7x3” hanging toiletry kit (which may fit in the larger mesh pocket on the clamshell). 

My iPad Air 11” would go in the laptop pocket in its keyboard case and my Kindle would go in the tablet pocket. 

I would use the top outside tech pocket for my 3-in-1 MagSafe charger, AirPod Pro 2’s, 2 USB-C cables, dual plug brick, and my Nitecore 10k battery pack. 

The hidden side stash pocket is where my clear liquids bag would go. And then a 21oz Hydroflask in the water bottle pocket. 

I would attach my Matador speed stash for my iPhone and sunglasses. 

https://bellroy.com/products/venture-ready-pack?color=nightsky&material=baida_ripstop&size=26l

So two questions…do you think this is all possible to fit in the Bellroy and do any of you own one who can give me an actual unpaid for review?

Thanks for any help, advice, opinions or sarcastic comments!
","['155 is an amazing price for the Venture Ready 26. \n\nI can’t really say for sure on if all that stuff fits though, if it does it would be a super tight fit. \n\nIt’s a great bag though.

It’s great, but the space and organization is quite limited. I wanted to go onebag and the more I looked at the Venture ready, the more it became an obvious choice. Then came the question, new version or old version? \n\nWhile the baida nylon would make this bag look more “corporate”, it’s imo the ripstop that makes it “Venture” on the black version. What appeals to me is the slightly more rugged nature of the bag in ripstop and the shiny aquaguard zippers. In addition I found a thread here on Reddit on the Baida nylon in black on an Apex bag from Bellroy, and it seems the nylon scratches quite easily. I’m not 100% certain they use the same nylon on the Venture ready, but scratches and building a rugged look that way would annoy me.

Bellroy or Aer?,"Hi, l've been searching for an EDC bag, to take to work and short weekend trips away. I've narrowed it down to the Bellroy Transit work pack and the Aer city pack pro. I love the designs for both of them, the roomy interior in the middle and the side/quick access pockets on the side.

I'm just not sure which one to go for as they are not cheap bags. The Bellroy is quite a bit cheaper compared the the city pack pro me. However I feel like the back panel/straps are far more comfortable on the Aer, the Bellroy doesn't look like it has much ventilation. I also do like the admin panel on the Aer for more organisation but this isn't really a must. I'm also liking the look of the xpac aer, as l've been caught in a lot of rain with my laptop and books/ other tech in my bag and I don't want to chance it on a semi waterproof bag. I could be mistaken but xpac I believe is a lot more waterproof than the original Aer? I'm not sure how well Bellroy fares though.

Does anyone have any experience with the comfort of Bellroy/Aer bags and are they worth the price tag?

Bellroy's horrible customer service,"So I ordered a wallet from Bellroy. The product did not meet my expectations, so I contacted support asking for help in doing a return for a refund.

I get a prompt reply asking for some pictures of the product. Sure, I reply the same day with pictures.

9 days later I get a reply that they've sent a replacement wallet free of charge, but I **have to pay for import taxes/duties**. What the heck?

First of all, I just wanted to return it for a refund, I did not want a replacement. Second, I sure as heck don't want to pay any additional charges! I don't even understand why that would be the case. I'm in Europe, my order was shipped from a European fullfilment center. No taxes or duties. Would they ship the replacement from the US or somehing?

Nevertheless, I've sent 3 e-mails since yesterday asking for them to stop the replacement and just help me with the return I asked for 10 days ago. Nothing. Tried the chat on their Zendesk and sent a message on Facebook. Still nothing.

Anyone has experience with Bellroy Customer service?,"I recently bought the venture backpack from Bellroy. After using for two weeks, a string came out on the outer side. The bag was carefully placed onto desks. There was no puncture, all I carried is a laptop plus an ALPAKA tech kit.

I contacted the customer claim, took them two weeks to finally reply. They concluded that the damage was caused by frictions from the tech kit inside my bag. Then they instructed me to use a candle to burn it, but not to damage the product.

That tack is 3-4 layers of overlapping stitching. The final stitch at the end of that pattern isn't providing any strength to the tack and you would need to keep picking and pulling at it to undo a lot more stitching before you made any difference to the strength. It's also much less likely that the next stitch in will get pulled out by similar wear and tear because it's actually been formed into a full stitch.\n\n                                 (\n      ___ ___ ___              ___)___ ___\n    ([___X___X___X    --->    [___X___X___X\n     )   )                        )\n\nThat is essentially what has happened, the thread end that's showing now didn't actually get formed into a stitch when it's sewn. Before the stitch is formed, with both threads on the underside of the fabric, the machine trims them off and leaves a short tail. The tail of the top thread can pull through to the front side but for the next stitch to pull through it would need to actually pull the tail of the bottom thread up through the hole as well and that takes much more force and is much less likely.\n\nFor $300+ I can totally understand being a little put off by the aesthetics of this but it honestly could happen to any commercially produced bag with that kind of visible stitching. Factory workers aren't going in with a lighter and melting the thread ends on the backs of every tack on the 1000s of bags being produced, so sometimes a thread end will pulled through to the front side. This is just a normal form of wear on any sewn product with this kind of tacking stitch.\n\nI'm sorry the solution of hitting those thread ends with a lighter isn't a satisfying resolution for you, but the reality is that warrantying the bag over this would mean throwing out a 100% functional product over the most minor (and solvable) of cosmetic issues."", 'I bought the apex backpack and the shoulder strap began to separate.

Evergoods MHP 3.5 to Bellroy Lite Sling - is the Bellroy really 7L?? Advice needed.,"Hello all I just finished traveling Europe for 2 weeks using the Evergoods MHP 3.5 to carry the following on body:

Wallet  
Passport  
Mobile Battery (MagSafe that just sticks on the back of my iPhone so not thick)  
USB-C cable  
Small hand towel  
Small eco bag  
Wet wipes  
Chapstick  
Hand cream  
Some bandaids  
Fujifilm X100 Camera  
Pen   
Small Note Pad  
Mini Flashlight  
AirPods Pro

It was a tight fit but it all fit. I thought for my trip to South East Asia next week I'd pick up something a little bigger and roomier but not as bulky as the MHP 3.5 is.  
  
I have a Belloy Transit Workpack that I use as my 20L EDC carry that I have been happy with so I thought I'd give Bellroy Lite Sling 7L a try especially since the Bellroy store on Amazon Japan had them on sale at 8700 yen (about $56USD).

The Lite Sling came in and  I packed exactly what was in my MHP into the Lite Sling and it was pretty much packed full and because the LS pretty much uses a big dump pocket stuff is hard to get  at.

So I'm sitting here feeling like I screwed up and that there is no way the Lite Sling is 7L. I feel like it's more like 4L max.

I've also learned it is not just about capacity but how that capacity is organized.

So can anyone help recommend a sling or pouch that is around 7-9L, lighter weight and less bulky? I'm a 5'4 guy at 135 pounds. Budget is up to $125.

How durable are Bellroy’s Backpacks?,"I’m looking at the discounted Bellroy Venture and figure I go for it - it was just 10 bucks more expensive than the Patagonia Black Hole I was going to get but I already have one (I was just updating it because it’s grimy and worn out).

They look quality, but over-priced for the warranty.  Most companies offer a lifetime warranty so I found that interesting.

My question is, how durable is your Bellroy?  How long have you had it and what sort of abuse have you put it through?  Etc.","[""I have/had several Bellroy backpacks over the years and probably wouldn't buy another. The main thing that really gets me is the three year warranty- which is absolutely hilarious for what's billed as a premium product to last many years. Hell, the Apex initially had the same but I think was bumped up to five years after backlash from the community. \n\nI've had issues with my GoRuck straps and the leather handles on an old Filson and was able to get them sent to SCARS and Filson's Repair Department with absolutely zero dramas. Don't even think I had to prove where or when I bought the thing. Whereas with Bellroy you can find countless stories here where warranty work is declined for the dumbest of reasons.\n\nPersonally, if you can get it at 40-50% off then I think it's an OK enough buy. I bought the Nightsky Venture at 40% off from their Outlet and was happy with what I paid (and yes, my straps slip sometimes). \n\nI think they make decent enough small goods and accessories, but bigger bags? I think I'd look elsewhere."", ""I have recommended Bellroy to multiple people were in the market for a more premium backpack but are not interested in the manybaggers backpack aesthetics. Each of these people have had their bags for ~2 years so far and there have been no quality issues. While I agree that Bellroy isn't the pinnacle of quality, I think this sub is too critical of the quality. Bellroy makes a product that  is in general better than cheap backpacks and uses nicer looking and feeling materials than even Patagonia (not more robust just better looking). If durability is a top concern, Bellroy likely isnt for you but I wouldn't be deterred based off this sub."", ""The fabrics are durable enough. The stitching is just fine. I wouldn't think of them as surviving hard use. \n\nThe stitching on the Chimera is good \n\nI will say though the older Lite fabric wasn't great. But it is being sold at the right price now in outlet. The replacement lite fabric is better"", 'Bellno, not just quality their CS sucks. Get Patagonia.', 'They\'re fine durability wise, depending.\n\nI bought a classic backpack a few years ago and the straps started fraying after regular carry. CS sent me a new one that\'s been fine. I\'ve taken the thing on a number of short one-bag style trips as my only bag and it\'s performed well and looked less travel-focused. The new one has been my day bag for EDC if I need it.\n\nI had a transit that was fine, but had some strap slipping issues with larger loads. Sold it and bought a PD 30L travel backpack instead, feels much more rugged.\n\nI also have one of their lite slings and I\'ve been really happy with that. It\'s been my ""tech bag""/EDC on a number of trips now and it\'s held up really well, enough to the point where I\'m not actively looking for a different sling.', 'I have quite a bit of Bellroy stuff. The aesthetics just speaks to me. Didn’t had any issues ever. Just came back from a long SEA trip. No problems at all.

No strap slippage, I have a newer version (bought about a year ago). \n\n- Bellroy Venture Ready Sling 2.5 L. Perfect size for my needs. Great organization. Magnetic buckle never opens unintentionally. I also use this one for EDC.\n\n- Bellroy Toiletry Kit Plus. Love the organization and look.\n\n- Bellroy Lite Pouch Duo. Light, versatile, good looking, convenient.\n\n- Bellroy Lite Laptop Sleeve. Provides good protection while being lightweight, great looking (i got it in yellow). It is waterproof, but there is always a small hole at the end of a closet zipper. Once i got under the heavy rain while carrying it (without a bag, just a laptop in the sleeve), so had to carry it upside down, just to be safe. The other small con is the fabric, being as gorgeous as it is (imo) it stains quite easily, but Bellroy replaced the fabric on their lite series since, so not an issue anymore.\n\nOverall i really like Bellroy products, the looks, the comfort, organization… i am using Bellroy quite intensely for over a year now and yet to have any problems.

Bellroy Venture Travel Pack 26L,"Looks like Bellroy have just released the [Venture Travel Pack](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-travel-pack). It seems very similar to the existing [Venture Ready Pack](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-ready-pack) so i've gone through the product listing and identified all the differences I can spot, here are some of the updates i've noticed:

* Luggage passthrough is now the same orientation as the main compartment opening
* Made from Element Coated Nylon rather than Baida Ripstop
* Internal pockets now open at the top, rather than the middle
* One of the internal pockets is now classified as a passport pocket with RFID protection
* Top grab handle looks much thicker than before
* Water bottle pocket is now zipped
* New detachable tote for 1.5 bag travel
* Only available in black for now
* Heavier at 1.1kg vs 0.95kg
* Taller and wider but slimmer. 
   * 560 x 400 x 155 mm vs 500 x 330 x 190mm
* Bike light loop has been removed
* More expensive, 309 vs 239 GBP here in the UK

Still doesn't look like there is any update to the straps, which has been the main complaint i've seen about the Venture Ready pack.

Just saw [Bellroy's new Venture Travel 26L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-travel-pack?color=jet_black&material=element_coated_nylon&size=26l#slide-0)

They fixed everything that made me have reservation about it.

* Right side up luggage strap
* Side zipper pocket
* The weird top pocket overhang finally has a purpose. Its now housing a packable tote.
* External loops for attachment bungee cords

I'm now rocking a MountainHardware Simcoe 28L when traveling with one bag. The Simcoe's laptop sleeve, having 2 sleeves in one is perfect for carrying an additional work laptop. But the side pockets aren't zippered. Luggage strap is improvised with side pocket pull tab instead of built in.

On the flip side, the Simcoe is slightly bigger and 1/2 the weight.

Bellroy Tokyo messenger bag,"Hello guys, I wanted to share some thoughts on this bag and hopefully help you decide whether this bag is for you or not.

Im going to start this review by saying that this bag is 300CAD. (yup, very expensive)

[Bellroy messenger bag front](https://preview.redd.it/m3azkry7lsoc1.jpg?width=6016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ad4458d75331143ea2b70604b73cfa5e9c7fe8)

**Some Backstory (you can skip this part if you want).**

I own couple of bellroy products, they have always stand out from other bags to me because of the quality of materials and the minimal design. It is very hard to explain but Bellroy bags ""feels"" good and are high quality.

Before I decided to buy this bag I was looking to replace an old Timbuk2 messenger bag, it was important to me what I could carry comfortably a 14 inch laptop and a iPad Pro 12.9 plus some cables. that is when I found about the Bellroy system messenger bag. I got in love with the inside pockets and something that got my attention was the easy access to the main compartment, secured by magnets and a little hook. 

Unfortunately for me this bag is now discontinued and where I live very hard to find, but just a week later Bellroy uploaded in their socials a little video of the new Tokyo messenger bag with the new color option and I got excited right away. 

According to Bellroy this new Tokyo messenger bag is a direct replacement to the System messenger bag.

**Size and materials**

You can get this bag in 14"" and 16"". I got the bigger one thinking I might need the extra space in the future but for reference the 14"" is 14L and 16"" is 18L. Looking at both of them at the store, the 16"" didn't looked bigger, maybe just a little bigger. The hard decision for me was picking between raven and everglade but eventually got raven, both of these colours are made with their new Baida Nylon (I really didn't like the plum color option).

Bellroy claims that their Baida Nylon is their most premium material, they used this material on the Apex backpack (which is very expensive, around 600 cad). The material looks beautiful, feels good to the touch and it is very crinkly. 

The bag is also surprisingly light, which I really liked. for reference it weights 1.65lb and my peak design messenger bag weights 2.67lb.

Bellroy upgraded the ""hook"" from the system bag to a magnetic fidlock closure, they also flipped the way you open the bag. (if you see the system bag, you close the bag to the front. while the Tokyo is to the back) this on paper doesn't look like a big deal and prevents pickpocketers, but this also make the bag a bit harder to open when you are carrying it. 

now lets talk about the magnets...

The main compartment has 4 magnets (2 on each side of the bag), this helps to keep the bag closed. Im just going to say that these were not useful at all, the magnets are too weak and have to be perfectly aligned to be able to snap together. The fidlock mechanism is ""ok"".

The front pocket is good, it has the perfect amount of space. On one side you can fit a kindle paper white + a phone and have space left, on the other side you have 2 pen holders and a key clip, the only thing that would make this perfect is that that they added more pockets to organize smaller items.

**Main compartment** 

This is where I started to get a little bit disappointed, im no expert on bag design but it feels that they used way too much material for the inner lining and the laptop sleeve. It feels baggy and weird on the inside, I have never experienced this on a bag. just look at the photos and you will see what im talking about.

This is how my 14"" MacBook Pro looks inside the laptop compartment, and I know what you are thinking, ""that bag is designed for a 16 inch  laptop, of course a 14 inch is going to look like that!"".

I also tried a 16"" laptop....

At first I thought this is not a big deal but when you put your laptop inside and start carrying it on your shoulder, you laptop is not secured to the side of the bag, it is moving back and forth because there is too much extra space.

&#x200B;

[See here how the laptop leans toward the middle of the bag](https://preview.redd.it/w8lnw3yjvsoc1.jpg?width=4675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8812713d53c0671dceff6dc0545ce30640472fa8)

The bag has 2 pop pockets to hold a water bottle and an umbrella, I was expecting to see the same pockets from the system bag because of the photos on their website but the new ones feels more like a downgrade, let me explain. The system bag had ""collapsible pockets"" and if you look any review online you will see that this pocket had something inside that will make the pocket collapse. I borrowed this video from a fellow Redditor, you can see how it works. [Collapsible pocket](https://i.imgur.com/DhAEJk2.mp4)

On the Tokyo version is just fabric. Again this is not a big deal but remember that this bag is more expensive than the system messenger bag.

&#x200B;

[These pockets won't collapse like the system bag](https://preview.redd.it/72eples81toc1.jpg?width=5355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=433866b9f9a88ad00237b46aa3ff506ad17c0c78)

Lets move on to the straps...

The straps are made of nylon webbing (if you need to compared it to something, it is like a car seatbelt), but the important part here is that it feels durable and premium. The shoulder pad is detachable and very comfortable. The strap is attached with metal hooks to a little piece of the nylon webbing on the bag, and here is where I got fully disappointed.

The very first day I had this bag i put my 14 inch laptop plus some pouches with cables and my switch, (which I consider a very normal load). walked for 4 minutes away from my house to take some photos for this review and the little piece of nylon started to rip apart from the bag. 

&#x200B;

This honestly horrified me, I have seen other people complaining about this specific problem on some bellroy bags. If I only walked outside my house and it looks like this, how is it going to look in 4 months? 

and to be fair I tried many different type of loads but in the end, just the laptop would make the bag rip more.

I went back to the store with the intentions of changing it for the 14 inch version, but I saw the exact same problems so instead I got a reimbursement. For 300 cad there are a lot of better options, you can even get better bags for cheaper. The only ""premium feeling"" I was getting from this bag was the external fabric which feels nice but not nice enough to justify the price.

To me it feels that bellroy made this bag and started selling it thinking that it looked great on paper, but no one tested it or cared to use it. It is shocking to see that their work bag has the same strap supports, was released a couple years ago and a lot of people has complained, but bellroy hasn't improved this. 

The Bellroy Tokyo messenger bag only improved with the materials used, but on everything else it is a total disappointment. 

And with this I end this review, ciao!

Macpac Quest 30L Review (+ Bellroy Lite Daypack and Bellroy Venture 9L Sling),"Living in NZ, it's pretty difficult to get access to some of the brands you see recommended here, especially to ""try before you buy."" I got some cool information on the Macpac Quest 30l from a review by a /r/onebag user so thought I'd add my two cents for my Aus and Kiwi friends out there.

The trip - 6 night domestic trip where we did 3 nights on a bike trail (Otago Rail Trail - Bags transported between accommodation for us) and 3 nights in an AirBnB in Queenstown. My main bag was the Macpac Quest 30L. I also had a Bellroy Lite Daypack in the laptop compartment (purchased secondhand on Trade Me) and a Bellroy 9L Venture Sling.

I somewhat overpacked as a test for future travels, and used 2x large Cipway zip compressible packing cubes and 1x small one. Packing list was:

Clothes

* Rainjacket (Uniqlo)
* Ultralight down (Uniqlo)
* 4x underwear, 4x socks (mix of ankle and normal)
* 4x t shirts (1x quickdry)
* 1x shorts
* Cheap, midweight Amazon AU sweatpants
* Lululemon ABC pants
* 1x ""no iron"" super thin black collared shirt
* 1x cotton collared shirt
* Hat

Tech + others

* 3x discs for disc golf (around 600-700g all up)
* 1x 3 port USB brick
* 2x cables (USBC + Samsung Watch charging thingy)
* Toiletries - Just the basics
* Bellroy Lite Daypack.
* \~8L dry bag (from Kmart)
* Vivobarefoot Primus Lite IIIs (didn't use em).

The Quest itself:

The Quest 30L is a pretty fantastic bag, it has YKK zippers, strong material on the outside + a removable hip belt that doubles as a duffle strap. I left the hip belt at home as I was aiming for 7kg anyway. All packed out, the bag came to 7kg on the dot, but I also had a maybe 2kg sling on... Wasn't an issue for Air NZ.

The opening cover has a zip compartment where I could put the 2x shirts, dry bag and rainjacket and it kept them flat and out of the way. Originally the Day Pack went into the laptop sleeve but once I used it just put it on the top of everything else later before closing it.

The Bellroy Lite Daypack:

This was everything I was hoping it'd be: light, not very ""strappy"" yet still able to hold a bunch of stuff. It seems to do better moderately packed out vs emptier. I took it up a mountain trail one day and had 2x 750ml drink bottles, rain jacket, puffer jacket, gloves, snacks, a huge sunscreen and fleece sweatshirt and it was totally comfortable. A bit slippy on the straps but nothing terrible.

Bellroy Venture 9L Sling:

Not sure if this is strictly allowed in this sub as I would be technically 1.5 bagging with this but oh well. I love this sling. I originally have tried smaller slings but just found them too damn small. If I want to, I can get a drink bottle + small umbrella in this thing. I also used it every day on the bike trail by dumping the whole thing into a side bag. Whenever we stopped, I knew I'd have my wallet, phone, small battery bank etc with me in an instant. 

Summary: 

I highly recommend all 3x bags and found they worked really really well together in case anyone was wondering. Happy to answer any questions on any of these bags too.

FYI: Be wary of Bellroy cases this time around,"I had the Bellroy Basalt case on my Pixel 6 Pro for nearly a year and absolutely loved it. I've got a drawer full of 6 Pro cases and no matter which one I tried, I always ended up back in the Bellroy. 

So when I saw Bellroy had the Bluestone case that looked like nearly the same color as the Basalt, I jumped on it. It took a few days to arrive (ordered from The Google Store), and when it got here it was everything I hoped it would be. 

The leather this time is a bit more matte than last year, but it makes it a little more grippy and I really like the way it feels. The buttons are still clicky. And the sides come up just a slight bit higher this time, where they protect the curved edges a bit more. 

I popped the case on my 7 Pro and loved it. The Mous case I ordered arrived the same day, so I popped off the Bellroy to try it and I like it a lot too. But ultimately, I ended up putting the Bellroy back on. 

That's when the issues showed up. I saw something sticking out over the screen on the top right corner. I initially thought it was a hair, but with some better lighting, I realized it wasn't that. It looks like this:

[Notice the top left and right corners](https://i.imgur.com/fpVoLFn.jpg)

Upon further inspection, this is what they look like:

[Top left corner](https://i.imgur.com/rrDRkbe.jpg)

[Top right corner](https://i.imgur.com/70s9ins.jpg)

The act of putting the case on **twice** shredded the leather in the corners. I quickly checked the Bellroy box to see if there were installation instructions I'd missed. Nope. 

So I contacted them and sent them the pictures. They responded today that this is considered normal wear and tear from where the leather wraps all the way around the front now. Except, as I pointed out, the 6 Pro was made the same way and didn't do this. In the end, they refused to replace it under warranty. 

So I'm returning the case to The Google Store and cutting my losses. It's a shame Bellroy doesn't seem to want to stand behind their cases when there's clearly an issue. If I didn't have the experience of using the same case with the 6 Pro, maybe I would've accepted their reasoning, but I've removed and reinstalled that case tons of times over the last year without issue. 

My recommendation is to avoid the Bellroy cases for now.","[""yes, i've noticed this as well.

I have the Bellboy Laptop Caddy which I keep pretty full. I'm looking to get a bag that would be able to fit the entire full Laptop Caddy into the laptop sleeve. I'm partial to the design of the 20L Via but I can't tell from any videos online if the Caddy will fit or if it would be too thick. Also considering the Classic Backpack or Classic Backpack Plus.

Just wanted to see if anyone had any combination of the Laptop Caddy + one of those backpacks and knew/could check!

Bellroy Lite Sling Shadow color,"Hi everybody,

Before I purchase one online... I see different hues (is that the correct word?) of the Bellroy Lite Sling Shadow. Sometimes it looks like darkblue/navy and other times black. I'm confused. Is this a bag that seems black in low light conditions and more blueish in bright daylight?

Bellroy Tokyo Side Bag,"I bought the Bellroy Tokyo Side Bag to try it out for size, as it’s so hard to get a gauge of what Bellroy bags actually fit from the images on their website. Was a pretty quick decision to send it back, which I was mostly expecting given its a 1L. 

But I took some photos of what I tried to pack in and what that looked like. Trying to get in my iPad mini 6 with a memobottle A7 was probably a bit ambitious, and as you can see from the photos it begins to bulge out quite a lot. 


Replacing the iPad with my kobo Clara helped a bit but it still just bends out of shape. I’m a bit surprised at what Bellroy show as packing in to the bag as it’s not that much more than I have. I’ve included a flat lay photo from their site. 

It’s nice looking bag and I really wanted to like it but it’s too small for my use case, and Im not a fan of bags that that lose their shape like this. I think it’s something about the fabric maybe that makes it bulge at weird angles when over packed. 

In any case I’m about to try out the Laneway Sachoche and Venture Travel sling as they’re a larger capacity with different materials. But here are the photos from my brief time with the Tokyo Side Bag for anyone who’s interested. ","['Not trying to hate on your purchase I appreciate your honesty and trying it out. But I think it’s a bit unfair to compare your attempted loadout with Bellroy’s photo. Obviously they’re going to over do the loadout but I don’t think this is a water bottle and tablet kinda bag. I don’t know many 1L slings that would even fit the iPad bulging or not. \n\nThanks for showing it though. I’m really not a fan of the zips on this one.', 'The next bag you’re looking at is going to do the same thing. Stack your items on top of each other, that’s how thick your bag will end up, at minimum. As long as your items are overlapping, there’s nothing that’s going to make it magically stay thin.', 'You’re right, probably a bit naive to think I could get the table and bottle in there. The style was basically what I was looking for but yeah I wasn’t too sure what the capacity meant for my carry. Unfortunately there isn’t much out there to show what it can fit - haven’t seen any review videos or other posts about it. \n\nBut I know now for future 1L will be too small for me', 'Good alt is their Bellroy new 3L sling it’s a bit taller but more “upscale” vibes than their past ones', 'This one? https://bellroy.com/products/venture-travel-crossbody?color=jet_black&material=element_coated_nylon#slide-0 \n\nI ordered one a few days ago.

How are your Bellroy bags doing after years of use?,"This is my system messenger bag after being carefully used for only three times (packed with a laptop, magic keyboard, umbrella, a notebook, Sony xm4 headphones, and several other small items), and the two connection loops look like this. Not that they're broken, just got a bit worried.
Although from my research, there is no complaint on the straps coming off, seeing this is still quite disturbing as I've never seen stitches like this before (all my other bags are timbuk2 and Aer), this Bellroy bag just doesn't provide the same sense of assurance.

Looking for some reassuring evidence to stop myself from worrying, thanks! ","['Holy moly, just use it man. Don\'t let such a tiny thing ""disturb"" you.

Often people are very off in their perception about what they perceive as defects in stitch quality. A common example is that naturally tails of fabric are left behind by running a line of stitching.

Bellroy Strap Issue,"Hi all, hope this is the right place to ask this. I spoke to Bellroy support and was told that both the Classic and Classic Compact backpacks currently available are the latest editions that have fixed the straps issue whereby they would slip or loosen too often/easily.

I am loving my Bellroy Lite sling inside my Bellroy Classic backpack!,"This is my current work and personal setup: I have a Bellroy Classic backpack in lunar that holds water, tech kit, journal, personal items, and then I also include a Bellroy Lite sling (color is called “copper”). The green and gray small pouch is by the Doughbut brand—bought that one on JetPens—and it contains work items like my badge and work keys. I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside.

Just saw [Bellroy's new Venture Travel 26L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-travel-pack?color=jet_black&material=element_coated_nylon&size=26l#slide-0)

They fixed everything that made me have reservation about it.

* Right side up luggage strap
* Side zipper pocket
* The weird top pocket overhang finally has a purpose. Its now housing a packable tote.
* External loops for attachment bungee cords

I'm now rocking a MountainHardware Simcoe 28L when traveling with one bag. The Simcoe's laptop sleeve, having 2 sleeves in one is perfect for carrying an additional work laptop. But the side pockets aren't zippered. Luggage strap is improvised with side pocket pull tab instead of built in.

Bellroy Tokyo messenger bag,"I couldn’t contain myself and bought this beauty.

Bellroy sneakily released this messenger bag a month ago and they say its the upgraded version of the discontinued system messenger bag. 

I will probably write a review soon to help others that might be interested on this bag.

Evergoods CPL24 vs CTB26 vs Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L,"I’m have some analysis paralysis and would love some feedback if any of you have these packs. It’s a good decision to have, but I’m struggling with it between these three packs.

Primary use case is as a personal item for travel to accompany a small wheeled suitcase. I’ll keep tech items along with a few overflow items such as jackets, shoes, etc. From the main suitcase. Size is a big deal as it will have to fit under seat.

Secondary use would be as an EDC.

Tertiary would be as a single travel bag for weekend trips.

My initial thoughts based on looking online is that the Bellroy and CPL24 are the best looking. The CTB26 looks a bit bulky in the pictures, but I do like many of the features. I do like the luggage pass through on the CTB26, lack of water bottle holders isn’t a deal breaker for me on the CPL24 as I don’t use very often. 

Thanks for any input you can provide. 
To note, I’m 5’9” 175 lbs.

","[""By the way for most of the Evergoods pack the laptop compartment does take up space of the main compartment. Evergood's literage includes all pockets with their individual literage not just the main compartment. \n\nFor instance an Alpha One Niner Whitley which is marketed as around 20L fits more in the main compartment than the Evergoods CPL24. Same goes for CTB26's main compartment vs some other bags."", 'I recently switched to the Venture Ready 26l because it was only $155. Pretty pleased with it. I have owned CPL24 (multiple versions) and the CTB26. I love Evergoods, but the Venture Ready layout fits my needs and organization style a bit better.', 'My CPL fulfills all three of those us cases for me and I have no complaints. It’s comfortable, organized, and personal item sized. Really have nothing but good things to say. Sometimes I miss a water bottle pocket, but if you don’t, then you’re set. CTB is bigger than I personally need, and I have no experience with Bellroy.', 'The CTB also has the front dump pocket which is pretty awesome.  The lack of dump pockets and organization in the CPL bugs me.  I switched fully to my CTB.  Have you look at [Aer bags](https://aersf.com)?   I have the TP3 and continue to consider the City Pack Pro as it looks pretty awesome.', ""I have all three packs you mentioned.\n\n\n\nThe Bellroy Venture Ready is hers, and she uses it exclusively for light travel (as she tends to overpack). For EDC, it's too big even for me. Otherwise, I love the pack. The top outer pocket with separator is really good. The slim side pocket with a key lanyard is borderline useless if fully packed (tight). The bottle holder has no elasticity and is kind of slim. I dislike the back with lumbar support - so that's that. :) Comfort is good, although the straps could be more padded and/or wider. Bellroy's classic issue with straps coming loose is better here than on some of their older bags, but it requires adjustments from time to time during wearing as it loosens itself. Materials are great and so far also quite water-resistant. Interior fabrics feel thin and kind of cheap to me, especially those mesh pockets. That is my observation. She is super happy with it.\n\nCTB26 is big. It really is big on the back. Other than that, it is stellar. I could not use it for EDC; it's too big for me.\n\nCPL24 is really good and can hold a lot. I tend to pack for travel minimally and can do a 3-4 day trip with CPL. But you have to pack logically and choose slim clothing.\n\nEvergoods as a whole. I really dislike their nylon materials. They are super nice to the touch and handle some rain. I tend to be cautious about how I handle my backpacks (except those made from Cordura), and ALL my Evergoods packs have scratches and stains that don't come off - and those things appeared the first week I got them. Now the Ecopak is a totally different story - I have nothing but good things to say about that material. The internal material is also scratched (top pocket), and the mesh is holding on quite well, but has this small bruise probably from the Steam Deck.\n\nThe thing with Evergoods, be it CPL, CTB, or MPL is - they are big on the back. The layout needs an organized approach for packing - but when you get the hang of it - it's great! For example, I can fit a small jacket and a fully filled CAP1 in the internal mesh pocket of CPL and CTB WITHOUT impacting the capacity of the main compartment and only slightly impacting the outer front pocket... Try that with Goruck. :) (on the other hand, GR1 has a deeper main compartment, so..).\n\n\n\nHope it helped. :)"", 'I own a CPL24, CTB35, and some Bellroy stuff. For your use case, I’d advocate the CPL.\xa0\n\nI love Bellroy but their design is more elegant than detail oriented. I’m sure the Venture is a good bag, but I’d expect there to be some interactions and use cases that don’t feel fully functional.\xa0\n\nEvergoods is supremely functional. The bags make great travel and daily companions. The CTB26 is really overkill for EDC, imo, though I know some people use it that way. I think the CPL would be a bit small for a proper travel bag, but as accompaniment to a roller or for weekend trips, I think it would be just fine.\n\nRegardless, I don’t think you can go wrong here.', 'I’d personally go with an AON Whitley, or Aer city pack/city pack pro. Cpl24 is just about perfect for edc/light overnight travel but kind of sucks as a personal item in combination with a roller bag IMO. The lack of water bottle pocket for navigating the airport is annoying, but the lack of luggage pass through is the real dealbreaker for me (yes you can finagle it by running one strap under the other and clipping it to the opposite side bottom lash point with a clip but it’s annoying and the bag still doesn’t sit on top of the roller as easily as an actual pass through strap)', 'I wouldn’t ever buy a bag without a luggage pass through again. If i did, i would take it to a bag shop and have one sewn on \n\nSo i own a CTB26. It isn’t perfect, but it is very good and I don’t find it that bulky', 'Just an FYI, the CPL24 is the only one of those bags that technically fits most US personal item dimensions. Some of the budget airlines have been cracking down lately and enforcing the size restrictions.', 'Well, I’ve eliminated the CTB26. I think it’s just a bit big for what I want. Somehow, per some recommendations, I’ve added the Aer CPP to my finalists.

I suppose you can’t go wrong with any of them.', 'Does this mean that if you only put a tablet, such as an iPad, there will be extra space in the main compartment?

Do you happen to own this bag? Just curious if the photos are doing it justice?', 'This is a great callout.

To your point though, it’s would be a little bit of a risk.', 'Did you end up going with any of them?', 'Latter. The design ate up a depth of the main compartment. Though if you really need to carry two laptops its compartment is awesome.', ""The bronze color (which I love) Venture is still $155 on Bellroy's website. I bought mine new on Amazon, same color and price. \n\nFirst impressions, yes, I would pay full price for the Venture. I loved my CPLs, but I didn't love how the volume of the laptop compartment takes up so much total volume. I always felt like it was wasted space when not carrying a laptop. You can pack that part of the bag with clothes, but I don't love doing that. That compartment is great for flip-flops though. \n\nThe Venture's layout just works better for me and feels more intuitive. Just my personal preference though."", ""I had a Venture Ready for a while. Loved the look, feel, organization, etc. The one area where it really suffers is weather resistance. Bellroy told me about it first--good for a splash every once in a while or a light drizzle--but there's a video on YouTube of someone putting out in very modest rain for seven minutes, I think, and pretty much every compartment gets water in it. Yikes. But if you're never in the rain or always have a pack cover on it, it's a good choice. Way more comfortable for me than an EG pack, but I have that back-digging problem with their goods."", ""LOL I was expecting some comment like this!  I don't use my bag off my shoulder, so the vertical pocket organization is not useful to me.\n\nCTB's dump pocket is key for me (relative to the CPL).\n\nHowever, compared to the Aer, which has many more slip pockets and a whole admin compartment, even the CTB falls short \\*for me\\*.\n\nAll that said, I am personally moving more and more towards pouches.  So even my organization comments might become irrelevant.  However, I do still like pockets so certain pouches or things still go in certain accessible pockets."", 'Is yours currently on ebay?', ""You can find measurements online, so I didn't measure them... :) But I would say yes, the smallest is the MPL 22, medium is the Venture 26, and the largest is the CTB 26. However, you need to consider how you pack the ~~CPL~~ CTB (edited mistake), as it's not an empty bucket like the Venture or MPL. So the perceived volume by the Venture could be a bit bigger.\n\nI tried a silly test, which proves little if anything :D:\n\nThe MPL fits in the CTB and the Venture, and the bags can be easily closed with room to spare. You could put the MPL in the laptop section of the CPL, but it's tight and impedes internal volume or the usability of the laptop department for a laptop...\n\nYou can fit the Venture inside the CTB and zip the bag.

I know Frontier has been (inconsistently) enforcing a ""It needs to drop into the sizer with no assistance"" thing. As long as you\'re not needing to bend something rigid to do it, you\'d probably be ok.\n\nI have a CPL 24 and use as a personal item pretty frequently and it fits all the US sizers I\'ve tried for personal items. It wouldn\'t work for something like Ryan Air unless you underpacked it *and* removed the aluminum stays and frame sheet as it\'s just too rigid. I know the CTB26 also has a framesheet and stays, and if they\'re sized porportionally with the CPL24, you won\'t be able to get any significant length compression even when under packing.\n\nIt\'s nice Bellroy got back to you on that.

Likely not going to be hiking with this pack for longer periods in the rain. \n\nI’ve also heard about the Evergood packs digging issue. Do you feel like you have a shorter torso length?

Nothing soaked through. Not a very long time to test out water resistance, but it's been the only rain we've had here in Virginia Beach since I've had the bag. I plan on buying a cheap rain cover though. \n\nOverall, I'm kind of in my honeymoon phase with the Venture. Nothing is annoying me a lot yet. I don't love the water bottle pocket and how it's non-elastic, but not a big deal with my slimmer bottles. \n\nI'm using it as an edc (I'm a teacher and I use it paired with a CAP2 and an Alpaka pouch) and a travel bag.

I don't get it, but it happens."", 'I\'d definitely say the Citadel has more space in its main compartment. It\'s not a huge one like the Dragonfly\'s, but it feels deeper, wider, and longer than the CPL\'s. Strangely, I have seen more than one review of the R3 that says it ""packs big"" for a 25L. I wouldn\'t say that, but I\'ve been surprised what I\'ve gotten in it over the months. That said, the CPL\'s back compartment with the laptop is way ""thicker"" if that\'s of use to you.

Just wish external pockets were placed opposite  since I’m left handed. I could sling the back and use the external side zipper for a quick access.\n\nAs for water resistance, it’s barely ok. I’ve used it under the rain (light to moderate) and water can sip in. You can see it in the inner liner. Nothing got wet, but it’s not reassuring.\n\nI also wish it had a little bit more structure to it, since it’s very hard to make it stand on its own, and it gets floppy most of the time, making using the main zipper a bit annoying. You have to pull from one of the counter pulls so the zip unwrinkles before unzipping (hope I made sense).\n\nSpeaking of the zipper: I’ve found the glossy coated zippers start to show signs of peeling off / yellowing after 6-ish months of frequent use.

More durable alternative of Bellroy Venture Ready,"Hi, I was highly considered Bellroy Venture Ready 20L. Beautiful design suitable for city, with ""durability"" occasional outdoor hikes. Then I saw this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-S1gsTvHdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-S1gsTvHdo) and I am very disappointed. This result I was not expected from backpack which is marked as water resistant and also for that money. I also found many threads with complaints about slipping straps and since then is Benture Ready no-go for me. I am willing to pay more money but it must worth it.

My second choice was EG MPL22 Ecopak, but I wat it in person, and I have no complaint about quality, but it miss sleek design which is more suitable for city and also my prefered backpack volume is 20L, I don't like big looking backpack, if will have 22 and looks not so big I am ok with that.

Do you have any idea what backpacks might suit my needs? Thanks","[""I own the Venture Ready 26L. I have experienced no strap slippage.

Bellroy Tokyo Tote vs. Alpaka Bravo Tote,"Hey all,
I‘m currently struggling to decide between 2 bags, namely the [Bellroy Tokyo Tote 2nd edition](https://bellroy.com/products/tokyo-tote?LSNSUBSITE=Omitted_zejn0xW3gLs&color=melbourne_black&material=fine_weave&ranEAID=3707496&ranMID=43345&ranSiteID=zejn0xW3gLs-V1qRp1bIX.5IHuChUM2XhA&size=standard#slide-2) and [Alpaka Bravo Tote](https://alpakagear.com/products/bravo-tote?variant=43575781327010). 

Mainly going to use it for work and gym, but since the gym is at work I need space for work and gym stuff in it.

So usually something like this:
- laptop
- some pens and small stuff
- lunchbox
- water bottle
- pair of loafers
- training pants and shirt
- clean clothes (underwear)
- towel

The Tokyo Tote has (only) 1l more capacity but at least on the product photos it looks more spacious. On the other hand the Alpaka has a pouch for small stuff on the outside which leaves more space inside.

What do you think? Maybe someone has experience using one of those?
Any insights appreciated.","['The Tokyo Tote is not a great bag imo. The laptop sleeve on it is pretty much useless as it’s oriented vertically, and the tote’s front pocket has no organization. All of the issues are fixed on the Tokyo Wonder but it comes at a steep cost increase.\n\nPersonally I would only consider the Tokyo Wonder of the two. I bought both, love the wonder but regret buying the regular tokyo.\n\nI didn’t know about Alpaka’s tote at the time but it seems similar to the tokyo wonder for a cheaper price. I’d go with that unless you prefer the looks of the tokyo wonder. But again I strongly recommend not getting the regular tokyo tote.', 'I used the Tokyo wonder for a while. I liked the organization but the material and the look of the bag just deteriorated after just a few months use. \n\nI recently got the aer city tote and I love it so much. The vertical zip isn’t great but i just use that compartment for wipes and diapers.', 'I have the Alpaka Bravo Tote and really like it- the organization feels intuitive and it works very well as a work bag for me. The layout pockets aren’t independent, so I do have to be intentional when packing out the bag. It does fit my standard size lunch bag in the center but not much else, but I use pouches in the side pockets and the outside pocket as well. I think it depends on how large your lunch is with your gym gear.', 'The strap on the Alpaka is a bit rough. The pad had no texture and slips off your shoulder very.  Size and build is good. Just wasn’t the bag for me.', 'I’d throw into the mix the Aer City Tote based on stated needs.\n\nhttps://aersf.com/collections/totes/products/city-tote?country=US', 'I apologize for hijacking the post but, has anyone had any experience with the ZTE quest tote bags? Specifically the Voyage (30L) and the Jaunt (25L)?', ""Obviously will depend on the size of your lunch box etc but I have the Alpaka Bravo Tote and I think you'll find it too small for your listed load-out. I found that I could fit my laptop, a tablet, my over ear ANC headphones, a water bottle, some EDC knick knacks like chargers etc. and that is about it. I can't imagine being able to fit in a pair of shoes and gym clothes and a towel in there in addition to work stuff. I think you would need something at least 20L and honestly for that load out I'd be looking at something closer to 25L. Maybe the AER city tote would work."", 'I have the Bellroy Tokyo tote, Aer City Tote, and the Alpaka Bravo Tote, and I absolutely love the Alpaka one. Its materials and fabric feel way more premiere, and the orgnisations are better too.

I used topo design pouches to switch up what I need. If I have both kids or just the baby. I love the side water bottle compartments for the kids waters. And mine fits comfortably inside the bag.

Just received my Bellroy Venture Sling 9L in Black (not midnight),"So I just received my Bellroy Venture Sling 9L capacity in color Black. Yes, it’s “black” and not the midnight color. So I figured out like since the release of this *new “black” color, there aren’t much posts or videos from any corner of the web. Let this be an appreciation post for the subtle changes with this *new color offering. 

2nd photo: matte textured aqua guard ykk zippers

3rd photo: black matte colored metal buckle

4th photo: fabric type. The front is kind of similar texture to cordura. The top and back is cross hatched pattern fabric. (I know! It’s baida nylon. These are just for descriptive purposes)

5th photo: black shiny non reflective brand logo

Coming from a Lite Sling 7l in Chalk color, which is a very hard color to maintain in terms of cleanliness, like it stains even in places or instances I never expect the bag to stain. In terms of capacity, I didn’t expect that the 2l would have that a much of leap! When you look at the 9l, we can say like oh it isnt that big yaddah yaddah yaddah but when I started to fill the 9l, oh i swear, it so satisfying how it can fit lot off my stuffs in it with still a room to spare other things!

This sling is my perfect partner for urban adventures, keeping my essentials close at hand while I conquer the city. It's comfy, stylish, and lets you move freely – exactly what I need to explore to my heart's content. This sling will be my new favorite sidekick for unforgettable adventures!

Bellroy Venture Sling 10L alternatives?,"Hi guys,

This is the first post here, but love this sub.

Purchased the Bellroy Venture sling as an alternative to my Peak design 9L. I am a photographer and recently acquired a Leica Q3 (lens is fixed 28 and cam is compact). I have found on a day-to-day basis the Peak Design bag feels overbuilt, is hard to get things in and out of, and the front zipper can't accommodate much once the camera gear is in; despite these qualms, it is a good bag. At 5'3 and 118 pounds, I sometimes want to have the ability to tighten the bag more. 

I  wanted something that was a bit more stylish, flexible, and easy to use, so I ordered the Bellroy. The PD isn't what I need when heading to the beach this summer and going for casual walks with my toddler daughter. I got the Bellroy, and while it is attractive and I really like the interior of it, I immediately found the straps are too long, even at their tightest. I like the sling and the ease of getting my camera in and out, but the bag doesn't feel well made, which is reflective of their 3-year warranty. The clips seem gimmecky and not easy to use, and the tripod holder (which isn't necessary, although nice to have), seem a bit too finicky.  I love the olive color and how it looks like a bag that could be used happily without a camera.  I don't need a bag that will last a lifetime, but something that can hold up would be great.  Tighter straps are a must. It was very close, but it didn't have the ability to pull tighter. 

I don't really want a camera cube in a bag. I need space to put a medicine bag, wallet, headphones, sunglasses, or other item. Something that could work on a smaller frame would be awesome. The 10L size was great, but anything between 6-10 could work realistically. 

  
Any suggestions would be awesome! Thanks","[""Check out offerings from Alpaka, I have been satisfied with their products. They have tons of options, especially in the capacity range you are looking for. They feel robust, but still lightweight and easily accessible, they also have a lot of olive color options if that's what you're looking for."", 'I like my Ulanzi PB008. It can be a dedicated camera bag with removable dividers but you can use it as a regular sling..\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\nit is a bit similar to the bellroy with two sided zippers, but not a ripoff. Has a grab handle which super nice. Inside is lined with loop velcro, so can slap in more organisation like pen holders or small pouches as you wish. Awesome.\xa0\n\n\nHas a backnpocket as well. I think the bellroy bags dont have that.\n\n\n\xa0Interior organization is nice as well. \xa0The materials are waterproof. front pocket is different than bellroy and better water protected. \xa0\n\n\nOutside is a very dark grey color and looks really good.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0Can highly recommend.

What I did like about the Bellroy was the softer quality and easier of get in the camera and out. Looking for something with less of a hard shell.

Just got my Bellroy 14 Laptop Bag,"I finally received my Bellroy 14 laptop bag and here are my thoughts.

It’s a laptop bag who wants to carry minimal stuff only, and can fit my 14-inch mbp with a hardshell case easily. 

No front pockets but you can store items in the main compartment.

Alternatives for Bellroy Transit Workpack 20L?,"I received mine today, but there are some flaws that are making me want to send it back.

* If I place it higher up, I have to readjust the length to take it off. Not only is it annoying and time consuming, but the fabric scratches my arms. Every. Time.

* If I place it lower to take it off easier, it pushes into my lower back.

Alternatives to Bellroy Venture Backpack 22L,"I bought the Bellroy Venture Backpack in 2022 and have been extremely disappointed.

The thing was uncomfortable out of the bag but I assumed I'd get used to it (I did not) - the angle of the straps, and their make, meant they really dug into my collarbone.

I persisted.... Only for the straps to give way after about 12 months. I had to put some sticky tape on them to stop them from slipping through the buckles - they don't hold their length and I'm constantly adjusting them.

*Anyway* \- enough moaning. Could anyone suggest an alternative around this pricepoint? I paid $AUD 350 in 2022 which is about 230 USD. 

I'd probably look at something slightly bigger too - maybe by a few litres.

Very grateful for any pointers!

Bellroy Venture Sling Decision,"Am finally taking the plunge into the world of slings and am leaning towards a Bellroy Ventire sling but am just looking for some guidance around whether to get a 6L or 9L one for my daily carry.

What I normally carry in my bag is - 

Alpaka admin pouch
Kindle Oasis
Peak design pack able bag
Power bank
Torch
Sunglasses
Keys
Wallet
AirPods

Am just not sure if I can get all this in a 6L or not.","['I owned the Venture Sling 6L and it will fit easily in it. For this reason, I would go with 6L. Furthermore, in my personal opinion 9L ist too big for a sling. I would rather carry a small backpack if I would carry more. A fully packed 9L sling on one shoulder is probably a bit heavy for carrying around for longer periods. Also, the aesthetics of a big sling are not as good in my opinion.', ""I have the 9 and honestly it feels small for a 9L sling. I can fit a 32oz Nalgene in there, and not much else. Take that for what you will. I dig it, it's a great sling, but Bellroys stuff tends to feel smaller than stated in use."", 'Take a look at my post comparing the Bellroy 9L to other slings. https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/fFjXdjfP32', 'For this stuff, the 6L will fit it easily.', 'Where did you get that slick Ultramarine patch?

Gave up on my Bellroy leather case,"I bought a Bellroy case for my Pixel 6 Pro after seeing so many positive comments about it here. It is a very nice case. It does not work very well so I'm back to a cheap plastic case.

The main problem is that the case blocks wireless charging with my Pixel Stand (v1). It sorta works but it's constantly complaining about alignment and charges slowly. I assume this is related to thickness, or maybe materials.

The other problem is the hole for the USB cable isn't quite big enough. Two or three USB cables I've tried all don't quite snap in to place.

I tried writing Bellroy support for answers about this and they never answered. $50 down the drain,","[""What color is it? If you're in the US and want to recoup some dough, I might be interested."", 'Bellroy case here. No issue at all with wireless charging with the old Pixel Stand.', 'No problems with my Bellroy case on my P6 and Stand 2', ""I haven't had any issues with wireless charging or USB cables not fitting with my bellroy case.

I also use the v1 Pixel stand, but I\'ve never had an issue and the USB port opening is perfectly fine.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, I love the case. The grip gets better with continued use. The only issue I have with it is that it\'s been showing some wear, especially in the corners. It doesn\'t bother me much and I might even be able to use some other leather conditioner or something to spruce it up.', ""I have to agree with all other comments in this post. I've had the Belroy case since December, used it v1 wireless stand and no issues. It fits snuggly and I have dropped it a few times.  Sorry to hear you have had a bad experience with the case."", 'no problem with p6 and the bellroy case here \n\n( .  Y  . )', ""Could be the Pixel stand itself going bad. I think coils start shorting out. And they'll still work but aren't as strong.\n\nI had a Anker stand fail the exact same way.

No issues since release.', ""There's probably a decent chance that it's more of an issue with the Pixel Stand than the case. I went from the Pixel 1 XL to the 4 XL and bought the gen 1 Pixel Stand, and I frequently got messages about misalignment. I would get them regardless of whether the phone was naked or using the fabric case, which appears to have been made to allow the coils to fit based on the cutout on the bottom. My 6 Pro works better with it, but I still get some misalignment messages.

Bellroy-like backpack?,"I have been reading posts here - so informative and helpful!

My lulu lemon backpack has taken 4 years of use with hardly and signs of wear, but 2 zippers just melted as it was resting near a heating element. So, I need a new one.

I really like some of the features of the Bellroy backpacks, but it’s really expensive - is it worth it?

I use my EDC for going to work, with laptop and lunch, sometimes cycling to work, overnight trips and as a carry on in addition to a small luggage for flights. I am petite so I think 20l is sufficient and lighter is better.
Also cute colours a bonus.

Got my Bellroy Venture Sling 6L,"Here's my EDC loadout:

* iPhone 13 ProMax
* Popsocket wallet
* Purist 18oz water bottle
* AirPod Pro 2's
* Anker MagSafe charger
* USB-C to USB-C cable
* Vape pen
* Knockarounds sunglasses
* Matador NanoDry trek towel
* Chapstick

Obviously the water bottle takes up the majority of the space. If not carrying it, I could fit a crap ton more in here. May have to look for a smaller bottle for EDC.

Disappointed with Bellroy Tokyo Totepack quality,"I happened to find the Bellroy Tokyo backpack (totepack?) In a store yesterday and I had been considering it to replace my ageing Samsonite Urban backpack.

I was shocked to feel the material and finish and realize that the quality is pretty poor for $200. Honestly, I'd be happy with the quality at $75 - like Tomtoc. The material felt cheap, the laptop sleeve padding was a bit disappointing and the finish was poor.



Made me realize wht certian backpacks are hyped so much you Youtube. These companies probably spend more on marketing than making a quality product, and influencers are incentivised to speak about these products more, since they make money on each item sold, and typically there is an information asymetry with the consume. I honestly will take all advice from YouTube channels with a huge grain of salt now.

Compare that to something like this, which has solid quality and is almost never discussed on YT:

* [https://www.samsonite.co.jp/samsonite-red/urbanz3/backpack\_s/black/ss-145267-1041.html](https://www.samsonite.co.jp/samsonite-red/urbanz3/backpack_s/black/ss-145267-1041.html)

It's hard to ship Samsonite JP backpacks to the US, but honestly I'd rather go for a US model or even one from Peak Design (I use their Totepack that I love for photowalks).

Was just sad to realize Bellroy is probably all marketing and no real quality.

  
Quick edit: The reason I made this post was to offer a critical voice in the sea of only nice voices on the internet about Bellroy! I like their design, and thought the bag was decent. Just wasn't impressed by the pricepoint and realized most reviewers have no financial incentive in criticizing the quality / value aspect. If you like your bellroy bag - that's amazing. If you don't think its a bit too expensive for what it is - that's great too! Obviously value means different things to different people! ","['All the stuff from Bellroy I own are excellent, but admittedly I’ve only gotten slings and accessory pouches.', 'FWIW, I’ve only ever owned a bellroy wallet (no bags).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that (like Patagonia) bellroy is a certified B Corporation- in short, their commitment to fair pay/labor and ethical, environmentally conscious manufacturing is well beyond most of their competitors.\n\nWhether or not that matters to you is a personal decision, BUT it does mean that, all else equal, their products will be more expensive than direct competitors. Put another way, for two equally priced bags, bellroy will have spent comparatively less on materials and comparatively more on labor.\n\nEdit: if you are looking for a bag to optimize cost to quality, check out Chrome Industries! Never had a bag as tough as my Chrome bag, even when I’ve spent twice the money', 'I’ve only had mine for 5 months but I love my so far and I use it 5 days a week!', 'How do you want us to compare it to the Samsonite that you linked? Is it really better? I can\'t tell, and the material just says ""polyester"" which could be great or terrible (though I do peep a cordura tag). The bag looks so basic I don\'t really know what to think about it. The more trad luggage companies like Samsonite and Tumi typically haven\'t made products I\'m excited about. Maybe you should make a Youtube video that we can take with a huge grain of salt lol.\n\nNot that your criticism isn\'t unfounded, but most of us probably do a combination of research, from watching multiple YT\'ers to reading reviews here on this subreddit and others. But at the end of the day, nothing\'s going to beat getting the product in hand and that\'s entirely subjective. Rushfaster just did a video where they had 10-12 different creators recommend their favorite item, and there was little overlap. So if they\'re all being paid by Bellroy, they\'re not getting good ROI. \n\nI love my Bellroy Venture Sling 6L, FWIW. But maybe Bellroy just doesn\'t nail every product--that seems just as plausible as ""Bellroy is probably all marketing and no real quality""', ""I think Bellroy backpacks do not display well in stores. If you compare how Samsonite display the backpacks, vs how some retailers display Bellroy bags, they look absolutely shit. Especially when they are flattened and hung on racks. Samsonite bags are displayed well, on shelves, and even on platforms. The bags themselves usually have some form of structure so you can make it stand and view it from all angles.

Just saw [Bellroy's new Venture Travel 26L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-travel-pack?color=jet_black&material=element_coated_nylon&size=26l#slide-0)

They fixed everything that made me have reservation about it.

* Right side up luggage strap
* Side zipper pocket
* The weird top pocket overhang finally has a purpose. Its now housing a packable tote.
* External loops for attachment bungee cords

I'm now rocking a MountainHardware Simcoe 28L when traveling with one bag. The Simcoe's laptop sleeve, having 2 sleeves in one is perfect for carrying an additional work laptop. But the side pockets aren't zippered. Luggage strap is improvised with side pocket pull tab instead of built in.

Bellroy Venture Sling 9L vs Camera Sling 10L,"So, now that I got a mirrorless camera, I’m trying to pick between the 9L Sling or the 10L camera sling.

I currently use a 7L Lite sling, which I like, but doesn’t offer the space or the padding to ocassionally take my camera out (a Fuji X-T4 with a zoom lens). The obvious choice would be the camera one, but I worry it’s not versatile enough for when I don’t need to carry the camera.

Anyone has used a 9L Venture for camera gear? What’s been your experience?

Color suggestions also welcome ;) 

Edit: Went for the 9L in blue (Nightsky). Really like it and it’s not that much bigger than the OG sling I got first. Looking forward for my first outing with a camera!","['Just get the 10L. It’s great, and it’s the only one that I know that’s collapsible. If you get an insert for the 9L, it’ll be boxy and much less elegant. I have the 10L and like it a lot. Good luck!', 'I can push the dividers to the side in my 10l and it becomes a big compartment. but having them helps organize even non camera items.... i love mine and find it the perfect size.', 'The only think i miss on 10l version is place to put 11inch ipad.  I am debating between wotancraft pilot 7l and bellroy 10l sling for my new ZF + 40mm + another small prime lens.', 'I bought the 10L first. I didn’t like how it was a bit stiffer. I found the side padding meant it didn’t compress like it should. It also was awkward to put a water bottle or loose items in when my camera was in hand. Lastly, it didn’t hug my back and wasn’t close when tightened up.\n\nI ended up swapping for the 9L, and still use it. The 9L compresses nicer and hugs your back better. I felt the organization in the 9L while less camera specific was nicer. I can also stash random items like my water or jacket when camera is in hand. However, without dividers it can sometimes be annoying when I swap my lens and just want to just throw the other lens in quickly without making sure it’s in the Domke Velcro wrap.\n\nI carry an XT3 and usually two fujicron primes, or the zoom and a fujicron. Sometimes I’ll throw my Ricoh or XA2 in with it.', 'I don\'t own the 9L but I do have the 6L and 10L.  I think a lot of people worry about the dividers but in reality you can push them flat against the bottom and its like they aren\'t even there, so there is no downside.  Functionally the dividers are nothing but a plus especially since the thing has some length.  The one thing that you do not have vs the 9L is a rear zip pocket and the rear slip pockets, you do get some subdividing zip pockets (sized for camera batteries) in the 10L\'s front ""sunglasses"" pocket though.  One consideration is the weight of your carry, if you do have a heavier camera and lenses you will appreciate the padded strap, and the padding even slides (I hate strap padding that is sewn in place, its such a fuss getting to where I want it).', 'Are dividers not an issue? I’ve seen they fold flat, but wonder if that really makes it essentially a 9L when not in camera mode.', 'Sounds a lot like the use cases I’m thinking of. Thanks for sharing! I’m looking up what the Domke Velcro wrap you mention is. I was thinking of some sort of ultra compact insert to use when carrying my camera, though I doubt that’s going to be as convenient as the built in dividers. That might be fine though, as at the moment I’m not planning to use it as a camera bag as frequently.', 'I looked into how the divider works and as you say, they’re definitely able to get out of the way if I want. What I do see as something I’d miss pretty quickly are the zipper and slip pockets the 9L has in the back panel. That I’d say would be the trade off to decide on', 'Sort of. They collapse … mostly … against the sides if you don’t use the ends of the pack as lens-holding spaces. When the bag is collapsed, they fold diagonally inside the bag, not to the edges. Maybe a YT video that shows that?', 'I wouldn’t use an insert. I did look and considered one for just dropping lenses in, but couldn’t find anything that was slim enough. I’ve traveled and used this sling and never been afraid of my camera getting damaged.', 'I have seen a few, but not one with enough detail about this. Will take another look. Thanks!', 'I looked into the domke wrap and it’s kind of what I was considering. Something more flexible than a camera insert per se. What’s your experience using the wrap?', 'It’s good. I wrap my extra lens and leave the camera unwrapped. The one downside is when I swap primes quickly i can’t chuck it in and know it won’t bump something else.', 'At the moment I don’t even have a second lens, so that might not be an issue. I looked into the 10L and apparently the inserts are pretty foldable to make it work as a single cavity, but I feel like I would miss the zipper pockets in the back panel pretty quickly when in edc mode.', 'The foldable panels were fine, but the interior pockets of the 9L were much nicer. Having my lens pen in a pencil pocket, cleaning supplies in a rear slot, and then inside the rear pocket my passport was just a much nicer experience. I often debate if I messed up not getting the 10l, but the pliability of the 9L is what sells me the most.', 'Agree on the pliability. I’ve been seeing several videos where they use it as a camera bag. Even the 6L. The only thing I feel I’d miss is the strap padding but meh.', 'So I went for the 9L and I’m pleased so far ;)', 'Great choice.

Bellroy Venture 40 vs 55,"Hi there I am deciding between these two size and curious if anyone have experience with both? In particular, I am looking to get a travel bag that I can use as a  carry on. The 55L is on the border of what is acceptable, but I figured with duffles you can pack less.

I would welcome any feedback from your experience of either/both of these bags. Thank you in advance.","['I actually have classic weekender 35 (different bag design and 5L smaller). I bought it because I needed to pack a suit for an overnight and was going to do some sightseeing before the wedding (traveled by train to the next city over). Had toiletries, a pair of shoes, the suit jacket and shirt and some souvenirs after the sightseeing. It was not stuffed so it was manageable.\n\nI think it’d be a decent size for a longer trip (5 days 4 nights) and I would take it on flights where they really pay attention to the carryon weight. I frequently travel for business and usually have a Briggs and Riley 22” carryon and backpack. When packed the 22” is usually over the carryon weight limit because the suitcase itself is already 5kg. I can see the lighter duffel allowing me to be within carryon weight limit. I don’t really use the 22” outside of airports so being able to push something around a lot is not necessary for me (the most amount of walking is usually airport walking). If I’m going to be doing a lot of walking around outside of airports I’d prefer duffle; it’s a little easier to maneuver vs a rolling suitcase. Duffles can be heavy on one shoulder so I would be mindful about what I’m packing to minimize weight (usually less clothes/clothes that can be easily washed)', ""I have one of their duffels. I think it's a really nice bag, but I don't use it at all. If you actually fill it up, it's just too much to comfortably carry around.

Chrome Kadet vs Bellroy Venture 9L and other alternatives,"Hello,

I’ve been looking for a ~9L sling (maybe between 6-9) for a while. It’s important to me that it is not a messenger or backpack by any means, but it isn’t also just for a wallet and keys. I’d like some flexibility in my EDC so that a water bottle, a folded document or some fruits as snacks can find their ways in easily.

I like the fit of Kadet, that it has external straps for modularity/compression, and that it is just a good size. The Venture is very popular and seems to be trusted, and I like the organisation and self compression design.

Which out of these, or a totally different sling around these sizes, would you recommend?

Bellroy Venture Ready Sling 2.5L,,"['FWIW, at first glance this sling doesn’t make any obvious design mistakes, which Bellroy has been known to do (i.e. neither the failure-prone buckle from the other Venture slings nor the slippery metal strap attachment from the backpacks are here). It feels pretty good all around, my one nitpick is the glasses pouch feels a bit precarious.\n\n2-wk EDIT: have tried it in a few configs now. The pictured full-load water bottle setup is doable in a pinch, but it sits pretty awkwardly on the body. Very brick-y, not uncomfortable but not ideal. I have an A6 memobottle in the mail, looking forward to seeing if that’s a comfier (& more sustainable) option. I do love the sling regardless, though. Build is great, it alleviates pockets + some extras really well, and it’s super low profile & comfy to use when not filled to the absolute brim.', ""I bought the same one in the midnight color on amazon and it arrived last Saturday. So happy I bought it before it sold out.   \nI love it its perfect for my pocket items and its also my first sling. Its comfortable and has a lot of space for a small bag. I also was disappointed in the sunglasses pouch it doesn't really work with my sunglasses.   \n\n\nMy problem now is that my GF bought me an aer day sling 3 yesterday not knowing I picked this up. After trying it on I loved it too. Its 3L instead of 2.5L, but man that extra .5L is a big difference. it still holds its compact form too. So im going to rock both this week and decide which one im going to return."", ""Thanks for posting this, its a question a lot of people have been asking, myself included! I finally got mine, still dialling in the usage. Here are [some pics](https://imgur.com/a/mHCnhvk) and initial observations:\n\n* Fits 16oz nalgene bottle well. Front pocket is still usable, some slim items like phone/passport can still fit in main body, but is a little tricky to grab them.\n* With the bottle in there, it definitely becomes bulky against the body, brick like. I'm trialling clipping it to a biner, which might work okay in some scenarios. The sling definitely looks better on the body when its slimmer.\n* Bellroy measure from the zip opening, the bag itself is 250ml wide, with the zip opening at 220ml\n\nSome early gripes:\n\n* I wish the phone sleeve was slightly more raised, that would make access a lot easier with the bottle/other items\n* I wish they kept the gusset opening, or at least a mini gusset so the sling can open wider like the venture line\n* Both the phone sleeve and the sunglass pouch internal pockets are too loose and flap around a bit, wish they were tight and expanded to make usage easier\n\nFairly sure a narrow bottle will fix a lot of these problems, but the memo bottle is too dear, and the nalgene oasis may slightly be too large."", 'a square bottle like the popular memobottle or GSI boulder flask could help \n\nhttps://gsioutdoors.com/products/boulder-10-flask', 'How is this as a fanny pack?', ""I've actually been using a Lite Sling (7L) because I know I wanted to carry more water. The sweet spot is 24 oz, but it can actually fit a 32 oz. Mainly use it for travel, but it fits everything I need without being too bulky: Passport/wallet, gum, tissues, power bank, water bottle, sunscreen, nanobag, can even fit in a Houdini jacket."", 'Been my daily driver for a few weeks now and replaced my Code Of Bell Annex Case', 'Gotta stay hydrated! Nice color', 'Awesome. Thanks for this! Ive been hankering for a smaller bellroy sling since I own the venture 6L. This looks right up my alley and the color is what I want too!', 'I would use a bottle with more leakproof construction. And yeah, even if the volume specs are accurate, adding another .5 liter is what a 20% gain? If 2.5 liters just barely works, that extra space makes getting stuff in and out far easier. Volume specifications on small bags tend to be highly variable on accuracy as in this example. You never know what you gave until it’s on the table in front of you.', 'How are the zippers? They used the same ones on a few other recent bags & felt very stiff/cheap.', 'OP, do you know if an iPad mini 6 can fit in there?', 'The ranger green looks amazing in this photos!', 'I would also say the strap is stiffer and less comfortable.  I prefer the softer straps on the lite  line and on my regular sling mini.', 'How did the A6 bottle go?', 'Yea I’m super pleased with the form factor too, I just gave it a real-world test and the glasses pouch wasn’t as useless as I worried… but I do think it could use a firmer lip to give it more definition. Or just a zipper.\n\nThe .5L difference is probably exacerbated by Bellroy’s ludicrous volume measurements, this whole bag could basically fit inside a 2 liter soda bottle at full capacity so idk how it’s a 2.5L bag lmao. If the Aer is actually 3L, it’s gotta have twice the space this does irl.\n\nThat said, I feel like I’m nitpicking endlessly so people can get an idea how this bag works given how few reviews are out. I really like it, it gets a solid A from me and it’s probably the most consistently good Bellroy product I have! Which is not for nothing considering I’m a ~~delusional fanboy~~ seasoned Bellroy user.', 'Could you try fitting a 16oz water bottle in both? Let me know which one works better!', 'What are your thoughts between the Bellroy sling and the Moment fanny sling?', 'Looking for this answer u/kingbugll', 'Hydrate or diedrate, y’know?', 'Sure thing! This is my first sling, I daily drive the Venture Backpack 22L and love it so I figured starting in the same line was a good call. Thought 6L was bigger than I needed so I snagged this one planning to exchange if it was too small. Happy with the size, plus I’m a sucker for this green too so win-win!', 'Hey, I am selling one of these in green in the buy,sell,trade thread. It’s brand new if you are interested, please take a look! All the best.', 'Definitely not a regular-use solution, mostly wanted to see about using a disposable in a pinch (also literally every useful water bottle I own is too large to fit in here lol).', 'Fine? Maybe a little stiff with the aqua guard. Basically the same as on the Venture backpack, I quite like those but I may be an uncultured zipper purchaser idk.', 'No chance. A basic Kindle barely fits.', 'The black one has softer straps (different material). Its nice!', 'Also curious about this.', 'Good to know. I was eyeing the venture hip pack (1.5L) as I wanted something smaller for basic pocket items. Now I am worried that the 1.5l might be less than 1L in reality lol!!', ""After today I'm going to keep the AER instead. The extra space comes in clutch. Also it's easier to get stuff in and out of the sling. \nIt's hard returning the Bellroy but when I pack it up to almost max it looks pretty bulky almost the same as the aer. \nBut yah I also don't have much complaints with the Bellroy maybe I'll come back to this one in the future."", ""I actually really like the Moment sling, it fits more than the 2.5L venture, the pockets and organisation are really good and front pocket is very usable. It probably has too many little pockets that I don't use. Overall its well designed, fits heaps if you like the look. I'm mainly switching slings for the aesthetics, the moment sling has a lot of straps, and I prefer auto-compression than Moment's compression straps. Also I don't like the huge bucket they placed in the middle."", 'Oh you’re thinking the same thing I am! I have the venture too in the same color… so getting this makes the combo together perfect!', 'I’m considering buying the Venture Backpack 22L, the front compartment pocket, if you place sunglasses in there are they protected much? As the pocket is exposed rather than goes inside the bag like other backpacks Bellroy has like the Transit Workpack?', 'That’s not true. I actually ended up getting one and I was able to fit it in. Granted, it is a very tight fit.', 'well I can answer this because I tested it myself, it fits and takes up like 90% of the inside lol. The 2.5L is great but it truly is best used as a pocket dump. Anything else might be overkill as hell for it. Bellroy lite 7L is better for all other things imo.', 'Hard to say! At a certain point you can’t overestimate size that much (i.e. my backpack is probably a liter or two smaller than advertised, if the same thing applied to the hip pack it would be 0L lol).\n\nI think it’s more a proportional thing—Bellroy tends to run a little smaller than advertised. There’s a good chance the hip pack is fine, idk if a 33%+ reduction over advertised size is gonna happen.', 'Your assumption is correct. The 1.5 seemed like my perfect EDC bag so I’ve been trying it out, but it holds a lot less than my other 1.5 slings. When you fill it, it becomes really difficult to access anything inside. I’m so bummed :( Maybe I’ll try the 2.5 but I’m worried it’s too big', ""The top flap has a pocket which sits in the front/outermost layer of the bag. The pocket has a microfiber-y liner, which is excellent at scratch protection and \\~useless for impacts (there's no hard protection built in). A plus of this design is, unless the bag is filled to the brim, the slightly-firmer front panel of the bag (between the zippers, where the top straps down to) sits between the glasses pocket and the rest of the bag, so there's a little extra layer of protection between your other stuff and the glasses pocket.\n\nI throw glasses (some cheap, some not) in there most days with decent confidence, haven't had any damage to them in my 10ish months of use. With that said, my experience is limited to no scratches; I haven't been hit by anything I can think of in that spot with this bag. (I only bought it bc my last bag was destroyed when I got hit by a car while biking so I'm attuned to impacts now lol. The Venture has better luck than my last backpack.) Glasses won't be *quite* as protected from the outside as the Transit Workpack, but how much that is really gonna affect you, idk. The pocket can also get squished when the bag is filled to max... which happens with basically any bag, probably less-so here bc it can expand out a bit in it's own panel. You can fit a glasses case in the pocket too, if you want.\n\nI also just gotta say that, despite how much I otherwise love this pack, the strap design is abysmal and nobody should spend $250 on it without that knowledge. There are some cool solutions on this sub apparently; I used the high-tech fix of... tying a knot in the straps, which has been 100% foolproof and a non-issue since I nailed the lengths, but that's a very easily unforgivable failure for many people so I just gotta say before I evangelize this thing. Anything more than a half load and it starts slipping. Fully-packed carry-on? Forget about it, you'll spend the whole airport pulling straps into place. The bag is otherwise perfect for me, I genuinely do love it, but that is the one massive flaw. I have black and it looks great, a kinda classy fun which works anywhere. Ranger green looks dope on my sling, too!"", 'FR? I couldn’t see how, when I checked if it fits the Kindle… and the iPad is considerably larger. Probably if it’s very lightly loaded, it allows for more expansion vertically. I tried the Kindle with all my EDC stuff still inside.\nI’m glad for you that it does.', 'do you think a regular kindle can fit in the 2.5L bellroy?', 'might need to order both for a side-by-side test lol. will check into the bellroy return policy first!', 'Thank you so much for your detailed answer, and sorry to hear about the accident. I have spoken to Bellroy customer service and they assured me that all backpacks that have the straps issue they send out the web keepers I think they are called to stop the slippage. Have you used the web keepers? Did they resolve the issue for you? I have heard positive things about them doing so.', 'Thanks. And you are right, I usually carry pretty light so I was able to expand it to fit the iPad mini.', 'In case you didn\'t get your answer somewhere else yet - it fits a Kindle in the main compartment, barely. Doesn\'t fit in the back ""padded"" pocket of the main compartment, since that is a bit raised off the bottom, but in the main compartment itself.\n\nAs has already been said: it\'s mainly a pocket reliever + some extras. I carry keys, car key, AirPods, sunglasses w/o case, phone, wallet, pack of smokes, lighter, small MagSafe power bank (5000mAh).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also own a Lite Mini and that one fits MUCH more - all the above + packable tote, Kindle, glasses w/ case, a USB-C cable... but ironically has less organisation (pockets).', ""I wouldn't count on it tbh, I don't have mine anymore but I believe my switch fit with no controllers on it but again it took all the space. It'd like fit their Lite bag and Venture 6l nicely."", 'I used Amazon in case I needed an easy return, but direct probably works well too.', 'Hmm I don’t have them, tbh didn’t worry about it after I got the ties right. I’ll have to ask them about it! Would be nice to try them', 'Yo so I received the web keepers 2 days ago & tried them out. For me… they didn’t fix anything. YMMV (and my straps are admittedly a bit worn from the knots), but the same slipping problems happened immediately and constantly (light load, laptop/water bottle/tech pouch in the bag). The root issue on my pack is the metal strap adjustment clasps (not the angle of the webbing). They are inexplicably smooth. If Bellroy have updated the pack design to include some (any) friction on those attachment points, it’ll probably work fine. I’ll be sticking with my trusty knots though!', 'Thank you for the response! Personally went for a tom bihn side effect instead as I wanted a nice fit for the kindle, im still thinking about this bellroy sling though', 'Was curious about one more thing - how secure is the fidlock? Does it take some effort to have it come apart?', 'Good point. Will opt for Amazon for ease!', 'If you tell them the problem they will send you them for free. They come as standard on all new backpack orders', 'In that case you’ll need [this](https://octosafety.com/pages/strap-keeper-for-bellroy-backpacks) third party web keepers', 'It’s a bit of black magic f*ckery, really. The magnet isn’t insanely strong or anything, but the clasp never feels like it’s in danger of coming accidentally undone & it never has for me.

Briefcase Mania:  Tom Bihn Cadet v Bellroy Via v Waterfield Bolt,,"['More than any other type of bag, I use and own suitcases the most as I carry them on my commute everyday for work.  I wanted to compare my current core three work laptop briefcases, the Waterfield Bolt (medium), Bellroy Via, and Tom Bihn Cadet.  \n  \nThe Waterfield Bolt is my favorite and is probably the most premium feeling, its also the smallest and most work oriented of the three.  It does have decent capacity so I can stuff a lunch and a drink or a hoodie in it along with the laptop and umbrella I always carry, but it doesn\'t feel like it can easily slide into other uses like the other two.  The Waterfield supreme suspension shoulder strap is my favorite though, its the Goldilocks in form and performance.  \n  \nThe Tom Bihn Cadet is the big boi of the three.  It can fit the most although it sits pretty slim when not packed and is actually really comfortable when sitting on the side of the body despite its size and padding, TB is good at soft construction which is good for wearing ergonomics.  The Cadets big trick is its fully padded interior so those with bigger laptops or tech that don\'t fit in sleeves, this is your bag.  My model is the TB 1000D cordura which despite is toughness is actually soft and supple under hand.  The front admin I also learned to appreciate for travel, it can fold down for easy access and has huge capacity like the main compartment.  A really great travel personal item for those traveling with laptops.  Airlines will never say your ""obvious"" laptop briefcase is too big.  The absolute strap is wide and curved and can handle the most weight.\n\nAnd the Bellroy Via, was a surprise for me as its super lightweight, but its laptop sleeve is great and is capacity is so flexible and surprisingly large.  The sleeve is suspended and pretty large (will take bigger laptops than the sleeves in the other two bags (I dunno about 17"" though, you may want to stick those in the cadet main compartment).  The padding is sort of along the back wass and in a rounded ""J"" along the bottom and bottom front.  This is a nice packaging trick as the whole main compartment can flex and expand easily to take more stuff than you would think.  This bag does not have a lot of organization, so you may want to look at the other two or their Tokyo line for those features.  But the lightweight, comfort and capacity really impressed me.  The strap is a little thin, and just not as great as the other two, but at least it has padding so carrying even a heavy laptop like mine is no problem.\n\nLike always feel free to ask any questions etc.', 'Thank you for sharing!  I just got my Cadet (used) and haven’t put it to use yet.  Been thinking it would be a great 1.5 bag, but it seems so large to carry with a travel backpack. Do you ever use these with a travel backpack?\n\nI agree that in general Tom Bihn bags are deceptively large. I keep calling my Synik 30 a TARDIS - it always seems to have room for one more thing!', 'Do you have a favorite?', ""That Waterfield is an absolute stunner.  I personally prefer briefcases with a separate compartment for the laptop so I am not paranoid about keeping a water bottle in the main compartment but to each their own.  I always thought that the Cadet looked is a little awkward looking due to it's height IMHO.  Vertical space in a briefcase is not essential.  Nice collection though."", 'I have had the Waterfield staad attache for about 6yrs and have a similar to affinity to it. \n\nGot their air porter backpack recently to use it for longer international trips.

Bellroy Lite Sling Mini,"Currently waiting on my new bellroy lite sling mini to be delivered. It seems to improve over the tradition sling mini, excluding a few mesh interior pockets. However, it does seem to open a lot easier and has a pocket on the gusket of the bag.

I noticed there were very few resources online to research this product, so I figured I'd purchase it from Amazon and try it for a few days to see how it feels. 

I'm a more minimalist packer, only taking essentials such as wallet, keys, cellphone, multi tool, flashlight, and other random small items. I don't carry water bottles or tablets in my bag, since a 12oz water bottle would do me little to no good when I drink a gallon a day.

Bellroy Transit Workpack Uncomfortable?,"To anyone who has the Bellroy Transit Workpack (small size), do you find it uncomfortable on your shoulders and neck for long durations?

I used it for up to 8 hours once and also 4 hours on a separate trip and I have found that it absolutely kills my neck, shoulders, and back. For reference, I only carried a journal, a vest, water, and tech bag for cables. 

I am wondering whether the backpack itself is actually uncomfortable or if I have some underlying issue with my body. I got a bad lower back, but neck and shoulders is a different issue that I don’t think I have.","['[deleted]', 'You\'re the first person I\'ve heard of that wears your Transit Workpack longer than I do!

My bag is primarily riding on a Kevlar vest though, so keep that in mind. When not at work I\'m not wearing the pack quite as much but I still find it comfortable enough. If I\'m measuring right, I have an 18-19"" torso and no underlying medical conditions or injuries. \n\nThere is definitely room for improvement.  It\'s silly that Bellroy doesn\'t port over the suspension from the larger Transit bags to the smallest one. The sternum strap and beefier padding would be very welcome additions. I\'m a big fan of load lifters but I can\'t imagine Bellroy adding them.', ""Honestly, carrying any kind of loads at extended period of time especially if you're not used to it will cause some discomfort and pain.

Are you using it?\n\nEver use an internal frame hiking pack?', 'I don’t have this pack and can’t really comment on it. But typically problems like this are related to pack load out, pack contents distribution, pack fit and pack design. I’ll be honest and say that I’ve never found a so-called work pack/tech pack that is comfortable for long periods, nor would I consider using them for same. I’d be looking at the packs from a manufacturer like Osprey, Gregory or others, who understand pack design/fit for periods of long carry. While I don’t have the Bellroy mentioned here, I do own several over brands and I wouldn’t take any out them out for this kind of long carry. I’d be pulling out my Osprey or Gregory packs, knowing they are properly fitted to me, and well designed for long carries.', 'I have this bag and I’d definitely admit to dealing with some discomfort once in a while too especially if the load out becomes a bit heavier (sometimes have 2 laptops and an iPad along with other stuff). I wear the backpack for much shorter intervals though so never experienced pain. What I’ve noticed is the positioning of the stuff in the pack had a huge impact.

It works really well for me and the internal frame/suspended mesh backpanel fit me well. (There is also a Stratos 34L). I do have some friends who use (and are happy with) one of the flavors of the Osprey Talon (it has several sizes from 22L up). The Talon is a lighter weight pack with a little less structure and backpanel.  Osprey describes the Stratos as having the AIRSPEED system vs. the Talon’s AIRSCAPE system. This is an example where IMHO you really need to try it at an outfitter to see what fits for you. \n\nAlso the Stratos and most Talon’s do not have internal padded laptop sleeves built into the pack.

The nature of the Airspeed suspension (as compared to the Talon’s Airscape suspension system) has it sitting off your back a lot more to give even more airflow. Anyway I like this for hiking as I tend to get very hot on my back.\n- On the opposite side the Talon uses the smaller Airscape suspension system, which hugs your back more, but still with mesh for airflow, and is better, per Osprey, for activities where there is more movement like cycling, more scrambling on hikes, etc. While I have a couple of the Talon’s I have not had a chance to try them out much yet.\n- In my photos, contributing to the Stratos bulkier feel, is that I keep my Stratos packed, ready to head out for the trail (which I am doing this afternoon), and I did not unpack it for the photos.\n- In looking at the photos, the Talon appears to me to have a slimmer profile in the horizontal dimension, as compared to the Stratos\n- In the photos — the packs are arranged Stratos on the left, then Talon 22 (green), and Talon 33 (blue).\n- One other thing I’ve noticed is that over time and variations of the Talon, it’s hip belt pockets are growing (thank goodness!). This has been a bee in my bonnet so to speak about Osprey packs — I have a iPhone 11 Pro Max, and when it doesn’t fit in the hip belt pocket, then the pack is usually a no go for me. It does not fit in the Talon 22, but does fit in my Talon 33, and just barely fits in my Stratos 24 (but it’s so tight I don’t use it there much). It appears from reviews they enlarged the pockets on the Talon Earth 22.\n- FYI The Talon Earth 22 is on a substantial discount on the Osprey USA web site right now.', 'Pretentious?

Architect Carry / Bellroy System Messenger,"Will cross-post in r/EDC. Thought this might be useful for those considering a Bellroy System Messenger. I have both the Tokyo work bag and system messenger and prefer the messenger. They fit the same amount of stuff, but one is more geared to shoulder carry and getting in and out of the bag is easier IMO. As you can see, it fits a lot! 

These items are primarily work carry, and will give folks some context relative to bag size as well as the content!

I love it, but it is definitely dark!', 'I have the bronze 9l sling. I love the color myself, and it certainly is a little more noticeable than my usual blacks and greys. The only thing I don’t like about it, is the interior color is not light, so things inside do not show up as well as they could - I don’t think other colors have this problem.

New Bellroy Venture Sling 9L,"I purchased it in Basalt (grey). I like it very much.

Very comfortable to wear, and fixes the reasons I didn't buy the original slings - lack of organisation pockets, the weird decision to not have it open the whole top of the bag and having the key hook in the big main compartment.

Basic album here: https://imgur.com/a/2YYOcKx

I won't bother posting too many photos of it as they're available on bellroy website, but as you can see it completely swallows the gargantuan 36oz Yeti water bottle with plenty of room left.

Quick question though, when fully packed, does this thing swing around during more strenuous activities?

How do you like the feel of the fabric? Deciding between midnight or basalt at the moment. Based on photos online I'm liking the texture of midnight more but would love to hear user experiences on the basalt\n\nEdit: In case anyone is deciding on the Venture Sling and encounters this comment, I ordered the Basalt color at first and then exchanged it for Midnight. Color-wise, the Basalt is quite nice, cool, and pleasant. It definitely had a bluish tinge for me but it is probably one of those colors that can change depending on the lighting. The reason I returned the basalt, however, was that the fabric was not for me. It felt quite rigid and stiff when I wanted something more flexible. You can actually see this in the photos on the website if you look closely enough (especially the top-down shots). The Basalt fabric keeps its shape and frame more rigidly while the Midnight fabric is a bit more flexible. Ultimately, it is a matter of preference but thought I should bring it up as I don't see this mentioned in other comments."", '>https://ibb.co/album/7JJLjJ\n\nWhoops: it appears that those photos are no longer available.

I'll be sure to let you know."", 'Anyone?', 'Good for both I believe', 'Lol, sorry, just reread the bullet points and saw that it is ""almost fully ambidextrous"". Were there some stuff, like zippers, that weren\'t as accessible on the left hand side?', 'Good catch!', ""I jogged about a block with it yesterday to catch up with someone. It doesn't fasten to your body firmly enough to be secure on its own, but I quickly swung it to my hip and held it to me with my forearm. It was totally fine to run with, better than a backpack certainly."", 'My basic assessment hasn’t changed. It has been really nice to have bag that carries everything I need and I don’t have to wonder if it’s overkill.\n\nI really like the style, features, and capacity. It’s very thoughtful. It holds about 110% of what I really need it for, so I’ve managed to jam an extra book in there at times. The only tiny knock against it is that it can feel just a little bit heavier than I want at times, but that’s partially on me for what I put in it.', ""I wouldn't be concerned in anything lighter than a downpour. Can't tell you how a downpour would go because the only time I've been in one, I had an umbrella."", ""Yeah I think it's just the perspective being weird. The venture sling is definitely bigger and the organization means that extra size adds even more usable space."", ""It doesn't auto-compress the way the older slings do. Personally, that's an improvement for me. The old slings were harder to get into when they were on your body due to that auto-cinching.\n\nI just emptied mine to test it. It has a bit of a fondant-like soft-firmness so it holds its shape even when it's empty. You really can't tell how packed it is just by looking at it. But it also flattens decently if you were trying to jam it into a pack."", 'I was just looking for something like this comment, thank you! I’ll go for midnight too!', 'Yeah their fabrics are awesome. I just received their regular sling in the safe color. Love Bellroy fabrics and construction', 'Is that the Basalt/HeiQ fabric? If so, I concur - I have it on my Tokyo Totepack Compact (which is a great bag itself; I’ll get around eventually to posting about it ... maybe), and I love the fabric. It feels really nice and looks professional.', ""The pictures on their website seem to show a slight blue tint on the Basalt. Do you see that on your bag?

1st hands-on with the Bellroy Lite Belt Bag (Arcade Grey),"Hi ! (French speaker here, sorry for the mistakes)

I haven't seen any reviews nor videos about the new **Belt Bag from Bellroy**.

I quite love the ""Lite"" collection, as I have (all in Shadow black) the Duffel, the Ready, the Sling Mini, the Daypack, and even laptop sleeves and pouches :D).



This one does not come in ripstop shadow color, so I choosed to go a little bolder with the arcade gray, which I like a lot !



I wanted something that was even more subtle and casual than the Sling mini to wear, for hot days when I'm in shorts and t-shirt for instance, or when I just need to drop some small stuff.

I tried to load it and I was quite suprised, as the internal org is absolutely perfect :

- Back pocket is flat, it fits my card holder and / or my phone against my chest, safe and does not mixes with keys

- Main pocket has a big main compartment, perfect for sunglasses, snacks, shopping bag, little EDC that you need

- In the main pocket as you can see on the 3rd picture, there is a diagonal stretch org, that for now I use to drop my keys when linked to the key holder / ring. It allows the keys to stay in their lane and not ""disturb"" any stuff that I have put in the main compartment.



Overall quite happy with it, it does not stands still, but it looks classy yet sporty, and it's - as its name suggests - very very light. Feels premium, and it's - I think - the smallest ""lite"" carry bag in their collection which is perfect for a quick grab & go :)



Feel free to ask questions and have a nice day !

Bellroy Venture Sling Size,"Hey all,

After many days of researching, I’ve settled on the Bellroy Venture Sling bags to take with me on my travels. However, I’m unsure on which size will be the one for me.

My plan is to take with me my Sony A7C II + Sony 20-70mm f4 lens attached to each other. Additionally, a power bank, charger, selfie stick, and other travel items like passport and my wallet.

I don’t want to get the largest size only not to use it. However seeing as I’m taking a camera with me, I was looking at the 10L Camera edition. Otherwise, I was also looking at the 6L to keep things small but not sure if it would be too tight as I definitely want to be comfortable to take things in and out.

You\'d have a lot more space if you had a pancake lens.  I took [a picture ](https://ibb.co/94Hwv5d)of my 6L with a Fuji x-E1 and 18-135mm which is approx the same size, but still a little smaller than your setup.  I also threw in a small anker 10K battery bank in there.  Its alright, but if you have a stick in there it may be a pain if you are in and out of it.  A little bigger bag gives you more flexibility, if you pick up some snacks/pamphlets/maps etc.  The 6L is small enough you can wear it on your front all the time, the 10L you\'ll probably prefer it on your back when you are not accessing it.  9L may be the sweet spot, but if you are going for as small as possible looks like the 6L might be able to do it, if your selfie stick is 9"" or under and not so bulky.', 'You should go for the 10L, I have the 6L and it’s only for EDC', 'I think the only downside to the 10L vs. the 9L is that that 10L can’t remove the camera inserts.

It’s the SmallRig SR-RG1.\n\nMaybe the 10L will be the better option for me in that case.', 'Yeah I don’t think I’ll need it for outside my camera uses.', 'You can push the camera dividers all the way to the sides so they take up no space, or you could even lay them flat on the bottom so it would be like not having them, they have a lot of range of motion.']","[6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2]","['2023-12-03 13:35:01', '2023-12-03 14:02:37', '2023-12-03 16:51:45', '2023-12-03 18:52:10', '2023-12-04 03:15:44', '2023-12-03 15:29:05', '2023-12-04 01:47:04', '2023-12-04 03:29:00', '2023-12-04 03:37:00']",5,2023-12-03 13:02:23

I’m ~6‘2“ so a longer/tall bag fits better
  
Size (20-30 L). Enough size for a laptop+ other small item’s. External pocket(s) for a water bottle and/or umbrella.

My last point to make is that the last two backpack makers - ULA Equipment and ATD Supply - though they might be more expensive the quality is there and they pretty much would survive anything.  They are a little bit taller, there shoulder straps are so comfortable, they are a lighter weight type of bags, they can expand to suit your needs, if I were to carry a heavier load - the Ultra Camino, ATD1, ATD2 materials specs and construction would be able to handle it and if I were to make a top 5 list of backpacks to get - ULA Equipment and ATD Supply would fill the top 3."", 'Don’t know if it’s been said but The Brown Buffalo ConcealPack and the A19 Whitley are great.', 'Thule?', 'Truce Design Daypack is a fantastic pack for the office and anything else.

Suitable for people who are a bit taller as it’s a somewhat big bag. The only thing is it’s not 20-30L. But I recommend just take a look anyway. \n\nAnother option are the Apex bags from Troubadour. Go to the website and take a look. I don’t like these so much as they don’t look as nice, but they are quite functional and still look decent.\n\nThe final option I can recommend which is maybe too techy for me but actually has a nice design for the office (it’s not as techy as Aer or whatever) is the Errant Pack from Boundary Supply. It has a sleek finish down the middle which looks nice, and if I wanted something bigger and still somewhat fashionable, this would be what I’d get. \n\nFinally, bag-list.com is worth checking too, they have good filters and a good number of bags so you might find something there.', 'Azo equipment?', 'Sounds like you need a Boundary Supply Errant!', 'I love my able Cary max.

Tom Binh or Bellroy? Student EDC/Travel,"Hello everyone, 

Looking to get my first quality backpack which I plan on using for EDC to college and occasional trips/hiking on the weekends. 

I would be carrying my laptop, notebooks (2) regularly and other edc gear. I read up about Tom Binh and am impressed by what everyone has to say about them. I certainly don’t like how they look, but I think they’ll grown on me. I’ve finalised two backpacks, namely the:

Tom Binh Synapse 19 or 25 
Bellroy Transit 20

Which one would you guys suggest, comfort and quality is #1 for me. As I’d be taking public transport a lot and also weather proofing is quite important as Singapore tends to get wet quite a bit. 

I’m 5’8, and if I do go for the synapse. I feel looking at comparisons of people wearing the 19 and 25. The 19 looks more proportionate. Is that the case or should I just get the 25. Happy to hear other bag suggestions as well. Thank you.","[""***I certainly don’t like how they look, but I think they’ll grown on me.***\n\nImo this isn't the case at all. On the contrary it'll bother you. It's sort of like when I buy a microphone but didn't get the color I wanted, it bothers me as time goes on. Or when you buy used gear (but heavily scuffed and ugly) but at a tremendous discount. Over time, it bothers you and you'll want something better.\n\nSo notwithstanding recommendations, I think you can safely ditch Tom Binh since you clearly don't like how they look. If you don't like how it looks why buy it. Buy something you DO like the look of."", 'What size laptop? \n\nTom Bihn makes very high quality bags. They are different than others, particularly on the front pocket array. I guess you like look or you don’t. You need to make full use of all those front pockets to get the real volume of the bag. I would go with the 25. Remember you need to buy a laptop “Cache” or add your own sleeve for good protection.', 'I used to easily recommend Tom Bihn when the subject came up. After Tom’s selling of the company, not so much. \n\nThe tone of customer service has changed, some of the core materials have gotten downgraded, and the prices have continued to spike. It even seems that the design philosophy has fallen off. \n\nYes, I understand the designs are not everyone’s favorite, but I appreciated them as very functional and durable solutions. That just doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.', '>I certainly don’t like how they look, but I think they’ll grown on me\n\nThese brands seem like overpriced bags that people buy because of their looks.

My Bellroy Tokyo Tote Trolly Strap,"This is in response to the folks here that asked me to post a few photos of the trolly strap I whipped up for my Tokyo tote.

Big fan of Bellroy bags here, but I also like to modify things where they don’t fit.  I’m solidly team spinner (long time business traveler) and I needed a way to attach said tokyo tote to my luggage.

Bellroy Classic vs Urth Arkose: Advice?,"Heyo, I'm a college student and it's time for me to get a new bag.

The two I'm between are the Bellroy Classic and the Urth Arkose, and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with either bag?  


Bellroy Classic: [Bellroy Classic](https://bellroy.com/products/classic-backpack?color=saltbush&material=looma_weave)

* I like this bag a lot, the aesthetics really hit for me.
* I don't love the gray on the bottom, but it's alright.
* I've heard a lot of good things about Bellroy on all the backpack subs.
* Finally, the material it's made out of looks pretty rugged.

Urth Arkose: [Urth Arkose](https://urth.co/products/20l-backpack?currency=USD&variant=42747205058711&stkn=825ac48be8c5&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=20990315025&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwztOwBhD7ARIsAPDKnkCRiIt-G2kenMJwPLihJx11oLSbFdpBLQblHB-MOLcoXZxgWWX4IrwaAgStEALw_wcB)

* I also love this bag for the aesthetics - it speaks to my heart
* I don't tote around camera gear, so I don't need that functionality but the pockets are cool anyway
* I can't find much of reviews around this bag, nor reviews with Urth in general
* I'm concerned about the material on this bag:
   * It's nylon, which is fine, but I don't love it. The price tag doesn't bother me, but the price tag for the less rugged material hurts a bit.

I'm a college student, so I'm not doing too much heavy travel, I'm honestly looking more at aesthetics than anything else, and liked the look of these two bags. Thanks so much for any advice!

Any idea why Bellroy discontinued the Venture 22L backpack?,"My favorite overall EDC bag for a while has been the Bellroy Venture 22l backpack with the hook/loop closure.  I don’t *need* a new bag but started feeling the yin for a new backpack, and I see that they’ve replaced it with a 20/26L zipper alternative.  Was there a big problem with the 22L and are there any plans to make a new version of it? 

Shopping around to find a new EDC bag to scratch the itch but can’t find anything new or interesting since the last time I did the rounds.  Currently using the modern wayfarer v1 for variety’s sake even though the venture is still the top pick… is there any reason to think Bellroy will drop something similar in the future?

Thanks

Thanks again!","[""Probably didn't sell well.\n\nIMO, it seems like they've tried the hook/loop design twice now and were not successful. They first gave it a shot with the Apex and (probably) realized the price was too high to sell well ($450 USD), so they discontinued it. Then they decided to give the hook/loop design a second chance, but by creating a cheaper alternative — the Bellroy Venture 22. The overall design _was_ different from the Apex, but it still had that that hook/loop closure on the lid.\n\nTbh, I didn't see many people here buying the Bellroy Venture 22L or the Apex.

Question on Bellroy alternatives,"Hi,

I'm new to this community. Stumbled here only after doing research on bags. So basically, my girlfriend saw some ads on YouTube and wants to buy a Bellroy classic backpack (20L) and a Bellroy sling bag. It will be mostly used for travel, local and overseas. She intends to get black for both colours, and I will be the one using the backpack while she uses the sling bag. These will be our Christmas presents for ourselves.

I just want to get some feedback on these Bellroy products (links below), as I have never used Bellroy before and right now there is no ongoing sale that I am aware of. Also, is there any other recommendations for other brands that have a similar matching backpack and sling bag? Budget-wise, I'm somewhat flexible.

Thanks so much!

Black (Raven) seems like a neutral color to go with my daily outfit but the everglade and plum color options are nice as well. I understand it’s expensive that’s why I need some advise before purchasing. Which color should I pick? I’m already in love with the design so other bags are not an option.

Bellroy baida nylon vs baida ripstop,"Hello, i’m looking into selling my Aer City Pack Pro and getting the Bellroy Transit Workpack.
I’ve noticed that it comes in either baida nylon or baida ripstop. Which is the better of the two?
Main points being durability, thickness, weather resistance and longevity.
Thank you!!","['I had the same question.  Emailed Bellroy and here\'s the response:\n\n""We\'re glad to hear you\'re interested in our products. Please consider that both the Baida Nylon and Baida Ripstop are high-quality fabrics, so you can\'t go wrong with either choice. However, the Baida Ripstop might suit you better if durability is your primary concern.\xa0\n\nConsider that the Baida Ripstop has the same base material as the Baida Nylon but is enhanced with a ripstop pattern, increasing its wear and tear resistance. This reinforcement also gives the fabric a distinctive visual and tactile finish. This ripstop pattern can prevent water from easily slipping across the surface, making it less water resistant.""']",[3],['2024-06-08 19:15:25'],7,2024-05-03 08:25:45

Really good Bellroy support - Really bad backpack,"If anyone reading this saw my post from a few weeks ago you will know my Bellroy carrying handle broke. I sent an email and within 24 hours a new bag was on the way. Well, unfortunately this new bag had the same issue. I noticed much earlier and was much more careful because of the previous issues. 

Bellroy has said they will refund the whole bag after contacting support. Either they have great customer service or this bag is a piece of junk that’s falling apart for everyone, I’m not sure. I wouldn’t recommend the **Bellroy Premium Classic Backpack**, but if you’re eyeing something else, their support seems up to the task if you’d like to try it. 

Preordered the new AbleCarry as a replacement, hopefully it gets here sooner rather than later. This bag is literally falling apart in the wait…

Alternatives to the Bellroy Tokyo Totepack,"Hello! I have been using my Bellroy Tokyo Totepack specifically as a backpack for over two years and have been on the lookout for something similar that is just a backpack.

* 14"" Laptop
* iPad (I love the designated sleeve on the Totepack)
* Water bottle (32 OZ, sometimes I use a 20 oz one to hold in internal pocket)
* Bellroy Tech kit
* Pencils/pens/various small things
* Keys/Wallet/Airpods
* Sometimes Sony XM5 headphones.

I am hoping to find a bag that can also hold a lunchbox comfortably (monbento bento box). Organization is not too much of an issue, I think in the 24-28 L would work well.

"Looking for backpack recommendations for an office job, ideally similar to Bellroy Venture","I bought an Evergoods backpack a couple years ago and while there's a lot I love about it, it's never been very comfortable to use. It feels like the straps are too wide apart, if I use both straps it feels like they put pressure way further away from the center of my chest than they should, and it's basically impossible to use with only a single strap, it just constantly slips off. This can get really annoying because there's a lot of time where I'll do something like walk from my office to a conference room, or from a bench to a bus, or something like that, where I'd like to just use it with on arm for a couple minutes.

I do really like the materials, the color, and the size. This is the bag:  [Panel Loader Classic 20L - EVERGOODS](https://evergoods.us/products/panel-loader-classic-20l) 

I want a smaller bag, I have a Tom Bihn Synik 30 I use for travel, or if I need more room for whatever reason. This really just needs to be able to hold a 15"" laptop, an iPad, a small pouch that holds some charging cables, some snacks, and that's about it. 

I really, really like the Bellroy Venture bag.

I tried it on at a store and it was super comfortable. I love the aesthetic of the pouch thing at the top. 

Unfortunately I've read that the straps slip for a lot of people. I found an third-party tool you can use to prevent this, but I don't really want to spend $250 on a bag that needs an accessory to be functional. Especially when it seems the bag has been discontinued, I suppose I could just buy a bunch of the accessories, but I wouldn't want to be a situation where it breaks and it's no longer made since the bag is no longer available. There's a new version, the Venture Ready, but it's bigger and has a new design that I don't like as much. 

Does anyone know of any bags that are similar in size and design?

I'm open to suggestion as well. Requirements are

1) Like I said, on the small size, I think 20-22L is what I want.

2) Needs to look professional. I see a lot of great reviews for backpacks from out-doorsy brands like Osprey, North Face, Mystery Ranch, etc, but they clearly look like hiking bags. I'd prefer something that looks like it was intended to be used primarily in an office.

"Help decide between Aer City Pack Pro, Able Carry Daily Plus, Bellroy Venture Ready ","Currently daily-ing the AER City Pack Pro X-Pac

What I like about the [CPP](https://aersf.com/products/city-pack-pro-x-pac):

* Big enough for daily and quick weekend trips. Great personal carry on item
* Clean aesthetic. durable materials. water resistant. No frills
* Clamshell opening is great for packing things for quick weekend trips or flights 

What I don't like:

* Very boxy look
* Protrudes out quite a bit as it's shorter -- tough when riding crowded subways or bus in NYC
* TBH i feel like its got too many pockets for every little thing so i end up forgetting where things live

  
Currently looking at the [ACDP](https://ablecarry.com/collections/all/products/daily-plus?variant=44265629909304) or [Bellroy Venture Ready 26L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-ready-pack?color=black&material=baida_nylon&size=26l) for a few things that I feel like I'd like to check off a list:

* I would like a slightly lighter (weight-wise) bag
* I would like a bag that's a bit more simplistic, not too many zippers, pulls, compartments, but enough for the things i need
* I dont want my back to look like a jetpack. would ideally like it a bit slimmer and OK with it being a bit taller too. the CPP feels like I'm wearing like a scuba tank
* I'm also only 5'11 but the bag looks like a childs bag on me. or one of those [bags people put their cats into ](https://reviewed-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--HENWdSLI--/b_white,c_limit,cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,q_auto,w_972/https://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1617725450000/3.png)

What I typically carry:

* I WFH full time but often go to coffee shops to break up my week and I will carry; a tech bag, hoodie or light jacket, water bottle, 16"" mbp, a notebook, and a little retrogaming device the size of an iphone
* I also use it as a weekend travel companion when I travel on flights; most of my stuff goes into my luggage bag but in the backpack i will put my dopp kit, tech bag, sweater/hoodie/jacket, chargers, snacks, wet wipes

My thoughts on the ACDP

* Looks unique but subtle. i like the xpac fabric. i always prefer black bags
* bag looks taller so i feel like it would look less jetpack-like on my back
* 21L is smaller than the 24L on the AER, but i rarely pack out the CPPP so the 21L seems like it could be a good size for the daily use and as personal item on flights. 
* the non clamshell seems like it could possibly be annoying when packing but these come so seldom i dont think itll be an issue. 
* i wonder if its self standing -- that would be nice. 

My thoughts on the bellroy

* I hate the logo but overall aesthetic is really cool. 
* i like that mostly clamshell opening. 
* i like the top loading pocket for quick access. i think it would be great for when i have the bag on the floor when I'm working to quickly grab charger, lipbalm, etc. 
* given that i seldom pack my 24L now, i wonder if the 26L is overkill. 
* for both bags i wonder if having the laptop in the main compartment will be annoying. ive never owned a laptop without its own separate compartment. 



I know these bags are all TOTALLY different but i cant imagine a better place to go to have this discussion with folks than here! TY in advance for any insights!    ","['EDIT: I don\'t know why this turned into a novel, sorry. \n\n> I\'m also only 5\'11 but the bag looks like a childs bag on me. or one of those bags people put their cats into \n\nIt looks like a big version of those little backpacks shaped like coffins that goth girls used to use (and maybe still use, I just see fewer goths around).\n\nAbout my experience before commenting:\n\n* I don\'t own the Aer bag but I\'ve handled it in a store and I own an X-Pac sling from them.\n* I\'ve never handled that Bellroy bag but I do have a Venture Ready 2.5L sling. I\'ve heard the new ""black"" colourway is a different textile to the earlier ""midnight"" colourway so I can\'t provide much context there, but I\'ve heard good things. \n* I own and use the Daily Plus from Able Carry every day (both to take things to my workplace and to cafes when I\'m WFH). \n\nI think the ACDP looks *vastly* better than the other two. That\'s purely a matter of taste I guess, but it doesn\'t seem close at all. The Bellroy is okay, and that Aer pack has always looked quite terrible to me. People seem to love it, but it just looks like strapping a cube to your back. Awful. \n\nThe ACDP is extremely comfortable for me, even when weighed down quite a lot and for long periods. The Bellroy\'s straps don\'t inspire much confidence, but who knows. \n\nThe ACDP does stand on its own almost all the time, in my experience. I\'m sure it\'s possible for me to load it in a way where it wouldn\'t, but with regular work stuff it seems to stand, notably both with and without my laptop in it. \n\nFor a daily work bag carrying the stuff you describe, I don\'t think clamshell matters. In fact I think if you\'re usually going to use it going to and from coffee shops you specifically don\'t want a clamshell. What people usually like clamshell bags for is that you can lay them down, open them all the way up, and really efficiently pack out the space inside. But in your use case, which is similar to my use case, that\'s actively a hindrance. You want a bag you can just set down and grab stuff out of easily, ideally without even looking inside. The ACDP is great for that. You\'ll just sit down, grab your laptop and start working, and reach in for your tech case if need be. Hoodie/jacket stuffed in the bottom, to be pulled out when you need. Clamshell is better for travelling if you\'re packing everything into it (like with packing cubes, etc.), but I think the use case you describe while travelling is a wash and clamshell isn\'t necessary. \n\nThe only issue with the ACDP is that it\'s a little tight inside. That\'s not a pro or con (people often say ""it\'s too small"" as a negative thing about a bag, when in fact it just means the bag doesn\'t fit their use case), but it\'s worth noting that it will feel smaller than the 21L makes it sound. In particular, I don\'t think it\'ll feel 7/8 the size of your Aer bag; it\'ll feel like two thirds the size maybe. The stuff you described will fit assuming your tech bag isn\'t huge, but it might be tight if you put a thick hoodie in there, and you might have to pack things in a certain order to get the water bottle in. It\'s just something you\'ll get used to and won\'t be an issue in time. I actually like having to be picky about what I carry. As the photos on this subreddit make clear, a lot of people seem to carry their whole lives on their backs every day. For your use case of working in a cafe, you\'ll need, what, your laptop, maybe one or two cables sometimes, and maybe a jacket sometimes. Plenty of space for that stuff. \n\nWithout personal experience with the Bellroy I can\'t just recommend the ACDP unequivocally, but I will say that the excellence of the ACDP, the difference in price, and the constant complaints you hear about Bellroy\'s QC and customer service make this seem like an obvious choice for me. Around me there are Bellroy bags in lots of stores, so see if you can get hands on one before making the decision. I will say that I moved to the ACDP after using an Evergoods CPL24 while was too big for daily carry, and given the superlative quality of Evergoods\' bags the fact that I love the Able Carry so much says a lot, I think. I\'ve never been similarly impressed by the quality of any Bellroy product (though this new sling I have is nice).', 'Comment regarding the Able Carry, who in their right mind would carry a liquid in the same compartment where all the tech including your expensive tech goes? for me that is a no go.

When you use the bag you sort of naturally bend the top back a bit and it slides right out. \n\nI actually like having the laptop in the same compartment for a work use case, since it means I only have to open one thing when I get where I\'m going.

Bellroy Classic vs. Urth Arkose : Advice?," Heyo, I'm a college student and it's time for me to get a new bag.

The two I'm between are the Bellroy Classic and the Urth Arkose, and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with either bag?  


Bellroy Classic: [Bellroy Classic](https://bellroy.com/products/classic-backpack?color=saltbush&material=looma_weave)

* I like this bag a lot, the aesthetics really hit for me.
* I don't love the gray on the bottom, but it's alright.
* I've heard a lot of good things about Bellroy on all the backpack subs.
* Finally, the material it's made out of looks pretty rugged.

Urth Arkose: [Urth Arkose](https://urth.co/products/20l-backpack?currency=USD&variant=42747205058711&stkn=825ac48be8c5&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=20990315025&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwztOwBhD7ARIsAPDKnkCRiIt-G2kenMJwPLihJx11oLSbFdpBLQblHB-MOLcoXZxgWWX4IrwaAgStEALw_wcB)

* I also love this bag for the aesthetics - it speaks to my heart
* I don't tote around camera gear, so I don't need that functionality but the pockets are cool anyway
* I can't find much of reviews around this bag, nor reviews with Urth in general
* I'm concerned about the material on this bag:
   * It's nylon, which is fine, but I don't love it. The price tag doesn't bother me, but the price tag for the less rugged material hurts a bit.

I'm a college student, so I'm not doing too much heavy travel, I'm honestly looking more at aesthetics than anything else, and liked the look of these two bags. Thanks so much for any advice!

&#x200B;","['I have the Arkose and my husband owns a Bellroy (but not the classic). While the Urth is nice looking, I find it really awful to pack with things due to the two compartments. The pockets are also so small you can barely get anything into them besides keys, wallets, etc. I can’t imagine using it as a school bag due to the top and bottom compartment construction - there is space to slide things down but it wouldn’t work as well as a normal backpack. I bought mine as a carry on item for my kids’ stuff on planes and really don’t like it.\xa0\n\nThey also sent me a bag with different zippers for the bottom compartment that open in and not out (some of their photos show it, some don’t, no idea why my bag doesn’t look like the product photos). It’s hard to explain but the zippers have to be touching for the bottom compartment to open, whereas most of the photos show a regular zip where they separate to open. It’s really hard to do one handed and clunky. Also the colour is more of a military tan than I was expecting. Overall I’d stay away, or order it and consider returning if it doesn’t totally work for you.\xa0']",[1],['2024-04-12 12:32:08'],1,2024-04-09 16:03:34

Bellroy Lite Sachoche,"Picked up the Bellroy Lite Sachoche to try it out as I couldn't really get a gauge of it from the marketing photos/videos, and handful of youtube reviews. Posting photos of it here in case anyone else is curious about it. 

I don't think it's for me. Because it's made of that lightweight fabric the bag doesnt really have that much structure and starts to lose it's shape as you fill it out and heavier items sink in the bag. The gusset at the bottom will pretty much sag out unless you've got really lightweight items, and I think that was the dealbreaker for me - it sort of looks odd. 

As you can see from the photos I tried it out with my e-reader, phone, wallet, keys, ear buds, tissues, sanitiser, lip balm and a small power bank. I could also squeeze in my ipad mini 6 but it barely fit. The front zipper was tricky to get open at times, I think because the bag loses shape depending on how it's packed out so the zip tape bends and you have to straighten it out yourself to pull the zip open cleanly. 

It's a shame because I wanted it to work, but the saggy bottom and bulging shape makes it lose the slimline and clean look it has in their marketing shots. Oh well, the search goes on.

Bellroy System Messenger vs. Bellroy Tokyo Work Bag,"I  was torn between the two of these, so I decided to buy both and see  which one I'd like better once I got my hands on them. There was a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/y9yvwz/bellroy_tokyo_workbag_vs_system_messenger/) on this topic a while back, but I didn't feel like it sufficiently  answered the questions I had about the bags. I'll emphasize these  questions and answer them with my own opinions in this post. I had to  opt for these instead of other options like the Tokyo Totepack because I  have a 16"" MBP for work.

TL;DR - I  think I like the System Messenger a bit more. It feels more premium and  despite having a smaller capacity of 16L compared to the Tokyo Work  Bag, I'm skeptical you could actually fit more in the Tokyo Work Bag  than you could in the System Messenger.

**Which one looks better?**

*\[disclaimer: this is obviously very up to personal preference, just stating what my preferences are!\]*

I  think the System Messenger wins out here, by quite a bit. Opt for the  System Messenger if you're looking for a more refined and professional  look. I think the Tokyo Work Bag looked nice in the product listing, but  once it arrived, it looked more like a larger laptop bag than a more  full-size messenger bag.

**Which one is easier to use?**

There's  a few aspects to the designs of each of these that pose their own  advantages and disadvantages, so I'll address them separately.

System Messenger:

* The  two pockets on front have separate zippers, which allow you to open  each pocket independently of the other one. However, these pockets are  pretty deep and are not the easiest to access while on the move. I've  found myself really having to dig my hand inside to get my keys off the  key-ring, AirPods out of the little pouch inside, or my wallet from the  other pocket.
* I haven't found myself really using the ""document zip"" yet, but maybe will do so to carry around a magazine or something.
* I have yet to travel with the bag, but I'm looking forward to the luggage ""slip slides""/passthrough on my roller suitcase.
* The ""pop pockets"" on the side inside the bag are a bit useful, but not as useful as I would have hoped.
* The  ""G"" hook on the top is actually pretty easy to use and latch onto the  bag via a plastic loop (that also has a magnet to the G hook so it stays  in place!). There's another extra loop if you pack your bag all the way  to the top and can't reach the other loop.
* The bag doesn't really sit up straight, which is a bit inconvenient at times.
* The  magnets in the fold-top opening are not super strong, so it's easy to  open up the bag quickly. I do wish they were slightly stronger.
* The zippers inside the bag are nice for storing some small essentials you want quick access to.

Tokyo Work Bag:

* One  of my biggest qualms is only providing one zipper for the front two  pockets. If you need to access something in the pocket further from the  zipper, you need to open the zipper all the way (both pockets) in order  to access the pocket. Given that the System Messenger has separate zips  for these, I'm pretty confused why this was the new design decision;  separate zips are easier to use IMO.
* There's  two zippers on the top, and they're a bit annoying to move around to  open the bag wide open. I've found it's a bit difficult to fully open  the bag (compared to the System Messenger).
* The spot to store documents is held together with a button, so things \_could\_ fall out (seems unlikely though).
* The water bottle pocket on the side is nice, but cuts into the space inside the bag.
* The bag sits up straight!

Some  pictures here: [https://imgur.com/a/7khaf2I](https://imgur.com/a/7khaf2I) \- my EDC is a 16"" MBP, Owala Free sip water botttle,  Peak Design Tech Kit (store most of my smaller EDC in here), and Sony  WH-1000XM4.

**Which one is more comfortable?**

The  straps provided with the System Messenger are more padded around the  shoulder and are wider than the straps provided with the Tokyo Work Bag.  I prefer the feel of them over the Tokyo Work Bag, but you can  obviously use your own straps.

The handles on both to carry it with your hands are both pretty comfortable.

The  System Messenger has a ""tuck"" at the base of the bag right under the  padded laptop compartment which makes it a bit more comfortable to carry  around.

**All in all?**

I  like the System Messenger more. It's a bit more roomy / easier to use  with the fold-top opening compared to the zippers and it looks a bit  more professional.

**If you've made it this far...**

This is my first bag comparison / review! I'm curious as to what I did well /  could do better next time. Feel free to message me or comment in thread  :) It was a blast to write this, excited to keep doing more and engage  with the community!","['Awesome review thanks! I’m basically where you are at- I want a biggish ( but not too big so can use underseat on planes- maybe 15-20L) shoulder carry work bag. Professional looking to use for work and travel etc. \n\nIts interesting you say the messenger is more roomy, as Bellroy says the Tokyo work bag can pack in 4L more . The Tokyo bag looks smaller to me , and I also agree a tad less professional. \n\nI’m also considering a few other options - Thule accent laptop bag or the crossover 2 laptop bag ( the non convertible ones), and also the waterfield bolt (even more pricey for Australian folk).  Still very much sitting on the fence tbh', 'Old thread but just wanted to add my two cents. I did the same comparison as OP. I bought both bags with 100% certainty I’d be keeping the Tokyo Work Bag, and I was wrong.\n\nI agree with just about everything OP says. Regardless of the size, the Messenger seems bigger, and more functional. It feels better built, and nicer overall. It feels a bit more thought out in terms of its layout, pockets, etc. I trust the optional luggage pass through on the Messenger more than the dedicated strap on the Work Bag too.\n\nI also thought the roll top was the worst part of the Messenger coming in. After spending a few days with it, it might be my favorite part. I think the magnet is a bit stronger than OP mentioned, but definitely agree with the other points. \n\nI’d carry both of these as shoulder bags most of the time, and I thought the shoulder strap setup was leagues better on the Messenger. It’s easier to get on and off, a bit better balanced, and just works IMO. \n\nAnyway, hope this helps a bit as well. Great read and review OP.', 'Another update 3 months after the last one on here :)\n\nSame as with the other fellow, I agree with almost all the points that OP has given. I just disagree that it\'s more roomy. If anything, it\'s ""about the same"" practically, but really I think that the System Messenger is ever so slightly smaller but not 4L smaller. The Tokyo Work Bag certainly doesn\'t feel like it provides 25% more room.\n\nWith a Hydro Flask, I can\'t even zip up the Tokyo Work bag properly.. meaning I have to put the bottle inside the bag. My biggest complaint with the Tokyo Work Bag is the single zipper for the two outside pockets.. agreed that it\'s a strange design decision. The front pockets on both bag are fairly hard to dig through when the main compartment is packed. Theoretically, the pockets on the Tokyo Work Bag should be easier to use because the material is elastic, but they\'re equally as tight and hard to rummage through. The front of the Tokyo Work Bag is also permanently wrinkled (it has to do with that elastic front pocket that\'s barely elastic) unless you absolutely pack those front pockets. The front pockets are definitely larger on the Tokyo Work Bag. The outside of the System Messenger looks cleaner but I\'d say they\'re both equally well-built. The document pocket of the System Messenger is useless if you\'re frequently traveling with luggage and using the pass-through (because that *is* the document pocket) but it\'s also infinitely more sturdy than the strap pass-through on the Tokyo Work Bag. The strap on the Tokyo Work Bag is more padded but thinner while the System Messenger bag strap is wider but has almost no padding.\n\nI live in a rainy city so I\'m not sure how well the fold-top will hold up but I think the System Messenger is the bag I\'m going to keep.', ""Thank you for the review.  I currently have the messenger bag and thought about purchasing the work bag because I need just a little more room.

Bellroy Tokyo Tote Advice,"Wondering if anyone has used the Bellroy Tokyo Totes in Both sizes and has a preference. Want to try a new business travel set up and the tote appeals to me. But not sure which size would work best.

It is TALL and WIDE, not deep. \n\nTwo, the fabric is an absolute dust / fur magnet. I have trained myself to ignore it.\n\nThree, while it zips shut (YAY) there is no pass-through sleeve on the back, which limits its versatility for me. I would also say it is not packable in a one-bag situation.\n\nWhat do I like about it? When you need to just chuck things in a bag: coat, hat, laptop, water bottle, papers, lunch...it's great, and holds those things gracefully. Love the bump out pockets. I think of it more as a car / errand / work companion though, and often carry it with a small sling purse, with the tote in more of an adjunct role. So in that sense, it works well.

Bellroy Transit Workpack vs Aer City Pack Pro,"Hi, I'm looking for a new backpack since my 6 years old Samsonite Ikkon is finally falling apart.

&#x200B;

I'm 5'6"" with broad shoulders, and I usually use this backpack to carry my laptop and everything I need for the office. Sometimes I'll take it for a weekend trip. I acknowledge that I tend to pack too many things with me that I usually wont need, so I'd like space for a 14"" mbp, an 11"" iPad, a small notebook, a couple pens, and whatever trash I pick along the way. 

One thing I hate are big, bulky backpacks. I like them to feel and look sleek, not like a cube on my back. I also prefer them to look more classy, something I can go on the street with but also bring to a meeting. Oh, and a fake bottom for the laptop compartment is a must.

&#x200B;

My two options are the Bellroy Transit Backpack and the Aer City Pack Pro. I also had the Alpaka Elements Pro in mind but I heard its a bit too heavy, so I discarded it.

Which one do you think its better for me?","[""I would suggest the transit workpack for you since it's not that stiff, heavy, and squarish compared to aer CPP.

Bellroy Venture Ready Sling 2.5l - is the volume really overstated?,"I am looking for a sling to help with additional carrying capacity when the backpack is not out with me (during vacations/outings/etc).

My wife has a Lululemon EBB 1L. I tested it and it gets a bit tight maybe so something a little bigger. The Bellroy Venture Hip Pack would seem to be a great candidate but it seems that Bellroy is generous with their capacity listing. I'd be worried it might hold less than the Lulu.

So I would think the 2.5l would be the next best option but if its a true 2.5L then it might be too big. So was hoping to get some real world feel for this.

Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus sizing - small for a 24l?,"I’ve had a Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus for a while now but I’ve always been irritated with how small it is. I feel like I can never fit everything in it! 

For example, I have a peak design small cube (fully expanded), a peak design small wash bag and a Bellroy tech caddy. I can’t actually fit these in the main compartment with a water bottle. I’d like to be able to include my Steam Deck sometimes, or other similarly sized items.

It’s listed as 24l on the Bellroy site, but then something like the Aer City Pack Pro is also 24l but looking at people packing it, it looks so much more spacious. 

Can anyone with the same pack give me some thoughts on how the capacity feels compared to other similarly sized packs? I guess I’m just trying to figure out if I need to go bigger than 24l, or if a different design would suffice. ","[""I have both the Aer pro pack 24l and Bellroy's classic backpack plus v2. The classic backpack is definitely smaller than the pro pack. I was annoyed by how frustratingly small it was when trying to fit my lunch and gym clothes along with a water bottle.\n\nThe shape of the bag and the fact that there's no water bottle holder makes it a bit harder to fit things."", 'Ah thanks for this, hopefully that means I’d be okay with a different 24l pack.', 'No problem.

Bellroy Lite Duffel,"After evergoods released their duffel I decided to order it and this bellroy one just for fun. The lite duffel finally just came in and I love it, perfect gym back or day bag or weekender. It eats nothing, packs full easily, Stays open easily, has plenty of opportunities for organization if I want it and super comfortable to carry. Problem is that I like the TD35 as well so I guess I just went from 0 to 2 duffels 😂 also the arcade gray is an awesome color! 

Side note: the bellroy shoulder strap attaches to the loops on top of the evergoods TD35 perfectly allowing me to keep the buckles locked down for a cleaner look! 😈 [Bellroy shoulder strap](https://imgur.com/a/ixQyIsA)","['So do you need an advise which one is better or is it a short story about becoming a ManyBagger in terms of duffels? \\^\\^', ""ARCADE GREY IS INSANE.

I am going to pack it and my CTB26 out later and see which holds more. If the duffel really does hold 4 liters more stuff and I might be sold to take it next time!', 'So first of all, the TD35 feels like it hold 10-15 liters more stuff. I packed the bell rot out and then placed it into the evergoods and still had lots of room to spare. \n\nThe bellroy stap is more comfortable. \n\nThe bellroy looks better imo packed out with the shoulder straps attached because evergoods shoulder strap is a bit odd. \n\nThe evergoods without the shoulder strap and packed out is beautiful but I need both options quickly available at all times. \n\nThe laptop sleeve is not a great design imo. It’s floppy enough that I would not want the bag loaded and have a laptop in it while shoulder carrying. It would pic a lot of stress in the laptop. I could carry that duffel on the other side but then my quick access pockets aren’t so accessible and I’m crusading my phone, AirPods, keys etc instead. \n\nThey both open up super nice on top and are very easy to access everything. I do however think that small gear in the bellroy could possibly fall out if you don’t carry the bag upright but I honestly don’t see that as a major issues depending on use case. The bellroy double zipper design will always be incredible. Works great specifically for a duffel! \n\nThey both do a great job with optional organization without taking up much volume if not used. \n\nThe TD35 is going to be hard to pass as a personal item for travel because it’s very square in north directions which is a little sad but the bellroy is definitely small enough to pass for personal item! \n\nThe carry handles are both very comfortable. I do slightly prefer the EG but only a little. \n\nThe EG will be used as a day or weekend bag where I throw a bunch of stuff into it like yard games, clothes, shoes and small cooler and haul it to a tailgate or campsite or pool/lake/beach party and it will work great but it’s way over priced for that. \n\nThe Bellroy will be a day bag for clothes, gym bag, weekend bag, possibly a budget airlines weekend bag. Or a packable bag for a longer trip incase I end up buying stuff while I’m at my destination. Another purpose I see for the bell Roy would be a trip like snowboarding where I could pack it in my giant suitcase then load up just what I need out of my suitcase for the day at the mountain like my snow suit, gloves etc. \n\nHope this helps some!', 'Hey curious if you can confirm the Bellroy duffel can fit under a plane seat?', 'NICE,\n\nmuch abliged.\n\ndoes bellroy lite outer material feel robust enough for checking?\n\ndid you take a look at the tom bihn yeoman?', 'Sorry that I missed the is message but yes it definitely will.', 'I would not check the bellroy, it has large holes where the zippers end, this makes it easier to get in and out of but it means your gear is not safe from the weather or from stuff falling out! \n\nI have looked at it the yeoman some but never thought I would want one.

UK: Bellroy 28L transit or alternative?,"I was sitting here wishing I could find some people to talk to and then reddit popped into my head. So here I am.

I commute to work either to my local office or by train and tube to London. I also do a few overseas trips - mostly short haul but one or two long haul a year. I'm not a light packer when commuting: I carry a huel bottle, a large coffee flask and water bottle, and when I'm at my local office often I'll carry running shoes and kit. And this is in addition to a laptop plus ipad pro 12"" and a tech pouch. So I need a decent size bag, but I'm still a commuter so I don't want anything huge. I feel like 25-28L would be about right; 35L ones, for example, look just too large.

I bought a Bellroy transit workpack 20L to replace an ageing High Sierra. I found it to be a nice bag; I love the aesthetics, and the convenience of the pockets as well as the nice zips and straps. But it was definitely a tad too small, and I didn't like the key hook in the side bottle area (why do they do this?). Final deal breaker was the lack of a luggage strap.

I wonder whether the 28L would be better. The key strap is on the front and it's a bit roomier. But it still doesn't have a luggage strap.

Are there any alternatives? I don't want a utilitarian / military look - I like the understated feel. I'm wondering about stubble&co. Any other ideas? All advice appreciated!

They're sold by London undercover in the UK."", ""Try the Able Carry Max. Much better quality and materials than Bellroy.

Trying decide between Bellroy Sling lite (7L) and the Venture Camera (10L),"Really having a hard time trying to decide between the two. I think part of what’s making this hard is I can’t even try the bags before buying. But this sub seems to be pretty knowledgeable with bags so I wanted to get some opinions. Here’s what I imagine I’ll be carrying in it:

-	Fujifilm xs-10 with an 16-80mm lens
-	extra camera battery (these are tiny guys)
-	Wallet
-	keys
-	sunglasses in a case
-	maybe my phone? I typically keep that in my pocket
-	a 20,000 mah battery bank (an Anker one)

I really can’t tell if the sling lite is going to be too small for all of this. I’m also open to suggestions of other brands too. I kinda like the wandrd sling but it’s looking way too bulky (and I say that as someone who has a prvke back pack which I love). Same goes for peak design. 

I really like the moment sling too, but at 2L, it’s obviously way too small.","[""I had the Venture 9L bag with a XH-1 & 18-135 hood mounted, sunglasses, wallet, other small items, and it was getting on the cramped side. If I had a shorter lens placing the camera vertical, it might've helped out with space. \nthe 10L is marginally bigger so maybe buy off amazon for a better return experience if want to try both beforehand.\n\n\nI ended up returning it because it's not a fully sealed bag and I was using it to carry my camera when going rock climbing and dust would get into the main compartment.

Evergoods CTB 26L VS AER TP3s xpac VS Bellroy Transit 28L,"I am trying to decide between these 3 bags, for one bag carryon/maybe sneak by as a personal item bag. 

1. AER travel pack 3 small Xpac
2. Evergoods civic travel bag 26L
3. Bellroy transitpack 28L

I am traveling internationally often, my requirements are a 25-30L clam shell bag with a separate laptop compartment that does NOT open TSA style, and then at least 2  separate quick access/tech compartments. I usually use one for my fluids pouch, and one for my tech. I prefer to keep my fluid pouch separate from the rest of the pockets for easy removal at the airport.  This will be my only carryon, but it would be nice if in a pinch the bag could also pass as just a personal item. Not mandatory, but its a plus this is why I am stepping down from my current 30l bag. 

My packing list is usually as follow

* x2 small peak design packing cubes. 
* x1 pair of sneakers
* small TSA fluids pouch
* small flexible dopp kit (8x2x3 inches)
* 13"" macbook
* a few small chargers and cables
* sometimes a Nintendo switch as well

I like to have a little bit of space in the bag left over in case of picking something up during the trip, or to shove a small light jacket, but I am usually traveling to places that are mild to hot temps. 

I dont care about waist straps, weight, or comfort as I really only wear it at the airport, and then dumping it at the hotel.  I also don't really care about a water bottle pocket, I seldom carry one, if it has it, it should be external, otherwise I don't really care. 

I am open to suggestions on other bags, but these are the 3 that I seem to have it narrowed down too. I am curious out of those who have owned them, which has the biggest main compartment, I dont wont a bag that loses tons of liters to tech pouches as I dont put much in these pockets anyway. 

I am leaning towards the AER travel pack 3 small xpac, but I am worried that its main compartment just wont be enough, id love to hear other opinions from those who own it, looking at my packing list, what do you think?

The bellroy is probably bottom of my list as I believe its the biggest of the bunch, but it does check all my boxes, this one I am mainly worried about it being just a bit too big, lol. 

The Evergoods civic travel bag 26L seems alright, but again worried it may be to small, I am mainly curious how this one compares to the AER TP3s, which one has the larger main compartment, I know the liters of all the bags are stated, but sometimes, certain bags can just pack more due to the way they are laid about. I currently have a 30L bag and it feels like theres waisted space in pockets that I dont use and I hate how the bag packs outward away from my body, it just looks huge on me. It carry's everything and meets all my criteria, its just an ugly big bag, that's the problem I want to solve. for reference, I am Male, 5ft 8 inches, 150LBS.","['A used tom bihn shadow guide 33 is fantastic value.

Review: Bellroy Venture 6l vs Tomtoc urban sling 8,"**Background**

I'm a 30y man and I've never owned a bag before. Backpacks seemed too much of a hassle for daily use, man bags were socially unacceptable growing up. I've always sort of known I'd like one because I love EDC stuff but it wasn't until recently that sling bags seem to have become common enough that I felt comfortable getting one myself. Thanks Gen-Z!

After much research, I landed on the TomToc because at £36 it was cheap enough that I wouldn't feel guilty if I ended up not using, yet good enough quality that I wouldn't need to upgrade if I kept it. Within 2 weeks of use, I realized I didn't want to just empty my pockets but be able to carry extra stuff I normally wouldn't so started looking for something bigger without crossing into messenger bag territory. At this point I was 100% converted and budget was no longer a concern, so I landed on the Bellroy Venture 6l for the extra size and quality, and because it was on offer for £92.

I'm writing this having received the Bellroy, but I haven't taken it outside yet. I couldn't find any reviews or even pictures comparing these 2 quite popular bags and I can imagine quite a few people in the same situation as me so I thought I'd share my experience as of today, I will update in a few weeks once I've used it more.

**First impressions**

My first reaction was shock: the Bellroy doesn't look that much bigger, in fact it's less wide!

https://preview.redd.it/gs50xbndv47a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d0b936fcc3473a5d63b533f92d39c00368f207e

I'm not going to lie, at this point I thought I made an expensive mistake. Looking from the top and flattening the bags a bit things did look a bit more encouraging, but I still thought going from 4l to 6l should have been +50% and I just didn't seem to see it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gzffnmfv47a1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a4fb0f27a49958e3b32aecf8db515fc0329810d

The outside materials on the bags are pretty similar. The TomToc feels a bit more rugged as it's thick nylon, it reminds me of the material my school backpack was made of: bombproof. The Bellroy feels a bit nicer, more grown up.

The straps are exactly the same seatbelt material, I wouldn't be surprised if they're made in the same factory, but the Bellroy has nicer hardware. Whereas the Tomtoc has plastic adjustments, the Bellroy has metal, and the buckle on the TomToc is this unwieldy and huge plastic. The Bellroy has fancier and much smaller buckles that use some sort of innovative mechanism. The main difference is that the TomToc is designed to be worn on the left shoulder only, there's only one buckle and the straps attach one on top and one on the side such that the angle of the bag when moving it from front to back of your body is perfect. The Bellroy can be worn on either side, but sacrifices that ""perfect angle"". [This review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7UOZksd9VM&t=300s) of the Aer Sling 3 touches on this same ""downgrade"".

My only complaint are the zips. They are waterproof which makes them much harder to operate because of extra friction (requires two hand on the Bellroy, only one on the TomToc). This is a bizarre design choice for two reasons: first the outside pocket zip sits inside a really big ""lip"" that would pool water inside it in the rain, and the zip isn't actually easy to close all the way to the end. This is because the belt actually runs inside this lip to help with the bag compression, but it creates a water weak point. This is nothing however compared with the fact that the sides of the bag are completely open, you can put your finger inside the bag when it's closed. This is a great tradeoff as it enables the bag to open really wide, but then why even try to make the zips waterproof?

**Inside**

Opening the bag was immediately a relief. The Bellroy main compartment looks huge compared to the Tomtoc

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u84qjg9kv47a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f319277e69d9f69cb246749e221ca76b6292faa4

At this point I was pretty confused. There was so much space and yet I didn't know where it was coming from. More on this later. I used 440ml cans for reference to show the difference in space:

&#x200B;

[Vertically not even 1 fits. 2 sideways and 1 diagonal the bag can close if you force the zip a bit, but all the other pockets are pretty unusable when filled this much.](https://preview.redd.it/kg4sk9zzx47a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0de02d85f0f524654235632bbb3ab7cbde78d12)

[I can close the Bellroy with 4 vertical cans + sunglasses in the dedicated pocket. The outside pocket is fully usable still. ](https://preview.redd.it/fdyfq9zzx47a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9d4c2792013581502bdd85631362cd6ba0e61a1)

The inside materials on the Bellroy feel slightly more premium, specially the pockets. I can put my keys in any of the pockets on the Bellroy, turn the bag upside down and they won't fall out, whereas they absolutely do on the TomToc. The glasses pocket is the best example, the inside is felt, the pocket itself is nice stretchy mesh and it sits at the top where they won't get crushed. I'd never have carried my sunglasses without a case on the TomToc, whereas I absolutely will with the Bellroy.

The pen compartment is way too short for a pen, but it fits my keychain flashlight like a glove so it's now here instead of my keychain.

The outside pocket is otherwise pretty comparable, the TomToc has an extra pocket outside on the back, but using it takes away space from the main compartment so I never used it.

The only downgrade from the TomToc is the lack of a tech compartment. The zipped inside pocket on the Bellroy doesn't fit my Kindle Paperwhite by just a few millimeters, which is very frustrating because this pocket could easily be slightly bigger both on the top and bottom, it just seems they didn't think of this use case. Leaving it here without closing the zip isn't too bad though...

&#x200B;

**Structure**

I think the thing I was missing before having them in my hand was that these are not two similar sling bags, but rather two completely different bags that happen to be meant to be carried as a sling. If you imagine the profile of the bag from the side:

* The TomToc is a **D**. The strap attaches to the top of the flat line (2 points) which is somewhat padded. The curved part of the D has no structure and will just adapt to whatever is inside, it relies on being zipped to the top of the bag to maintain integrity. If you try to carry the bag with the zip open, it just falls apart. The bottom of the bag is very narrow.
* The Bellroy is a **U.** The straps attach to all 4 corners and there's decent padding and structure on the back, bottom, and half of the front. The only part that isn't padded is the top of the front side, which allows it to bend and deform when opening the bag really wide. The bag can be carried without closing the zip (e.g with the 4 cans like in the earlier picture but with a power bank, kindle and phone) and it won't fall apart. This isn't very practical but you get the idea. Because of this shape, the opening at the top is huge and very practical.

&#x200B;

[See the U and the D?](https://preview.redd.it/xzvqkd5u057a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1d6147dd6f3c0fd309377bdb423f87880231698)

[This is the key to the Bellroy space. The bottom is huge and the TomToc bottom is very narrow](https://preview.redd.it/beh2ie5u057a1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4034b1fc05751838e75008c7b58db623507dad49)

**Conclusion**

All in all, I'm satisfied with the Bellroy. I can fit everything in the initial list which wasn't possible at all on the TomToc (mainly due to the headphones which barely fit even by themselves). The bag is nicer and even with all my stuff in it, it feels like I could pick up a water bottle on the go or a packable jacket and fit it. The zips are a bit annoying and the lack of dedicated pocket for the Kindle is a bummer, but I'd prefer it even if it wasn't able to carry more things due to the way the bag is structured.

I think the TomToc is still a perfectly fine bag and it gives the Bellroy a run for the money. If I had airpods and no Kindle, I'd be happy to use this as a daily driver for just going out of the house, but I wouldn't use it for travel or outdoors purely because it can only fit the bare minimum. In this scenario, I'd probably pick up a slightly larger option than this Bellroy as a dedicated bag for days when I need extra space. This Bellroy isn't that much larger to justify owning it alongside the TomToc as the use cases have too much overlap, so I will be returning the TomToc.  


**2 month update.**

I have now been using the Bellroy daily and for a few holiday trips abroad. My opinion for daily use hasn't changed, I'm perfectly happy and there is no sign of wear. For traveling, this has been a godsend as an alternative to a daypack. I travel with an Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Bellroy is perfect for having with you at all times when I leave the Osprey in the hotel for the day. Carrying both is super natural, Bellroy in front as a sling, Oprey behind as a backpack. You can walk a long way like this and never feel like you need to put anything down.

**4 month update.**

I've gotten used to the zips and no longer find then annoying. I still have my doubts as to how well this bag would keep water out, but I could believe it will survive light rain better than if it didn't have the waterproof zips.

I've also bought some sony linkbuds S to get even more space available which makes the bag plenty big for EDC, but recently I've been traveling with someone who has the same farpoint 40 and a Patagonia Atom 8L and I have to say I'm often envious of the extra space. He can carry everything I carry + a medium size hydroflask and strap his jacket to the outside with the 2 straps. The bag main strap is padded which is more comfortable but at the same time both the bag and strap are much hotter. We are traveling a tropical country during hot season and the difference is noticeable.

Bellroy Lite Duffel Vs Venture Duffel 40L,"I'm looking to get one of these two bags, so any help or advice is welcome!

It would mainly be used for going to the gym, It would have gym kit (including shoes), toiletries and a towel, as well as a pair of headphones.

I'd also like to use it as a carry-on travel bag for short haul European flights lasting 2/3 nights. I normally fill a 22 litre Osprey Talon, but have been leaning towards travelling with a duffel recently. I know that the Venture is slightly larger than Easyjet's baggage limit, but I feel like it's close enough that I'd get away with it...

I'm not leaning to either way at the moment, and there's only £20 difference between the two at the moment... so I guess the question Is, Is 40L overkill? Or would I have a permanent sense of FOMO if I opted for the 30L lite?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! ","['I have the Venture 40L Duffel I use as my powerlifting gym bag right now! I was torn between the Lite and the Venture but I went with the latter mostly because of the super wide opening. The material is also really nice to the touch (but apparently this is a very subjective and controversial opinion).\n\nMy usual powerlifting gear would be a bit too full in a 30L bag, and I think this 40L is just nice. I carried it to a meet too with change of clothes etc, food, etc.', ""The material on the lite is a lot less tough than the venture material, but its a lot lighter, for gym stuff that you aren't trying to pack away into another piece of luggage (which is sort of how I interpret the use case of the lite series) you probably be happier long term day to day with the venture version.""]","[1, 1]","['2024-03-25 15:03:34', '2024-03-25 23:07:56']",3,2024-03-25 14:48:57

I am glad there’s a generic version, that will be available down the road for people to experience the same feature set.

The Chimera has some sort of slight blueish tint when compared directly.', 'You can stack a medium thick jacket or rain coat inside the bag, 3-4 more 200 page books or 2-3 medium sized food boxes (bento boxes). It really adds some flexibility, but don’t expect huge gains here. It is quite similar to the Peak Design Everday Backpack which I also owned.', 'The Venture Backpack is really nice, I like it even more than my Bellroy Apex. Compared to the Chimera, it is extremely hard to justify double the price of that limited edition bag. It’s literally the exact same bag with some nitpicky details being different. However in person, the Venture backpack just looks more professional and sophisticated making it a more suitable option for EDC/the office than the Chimera! I like the Chimera a lot less now and regret buying it.', 'The hooking mechanism seems to be perfected on the Venture as well. On the Apex, it is really really hard to unhook at times, see my video on another post for reference. The Chimera just unhooks way to easy, it’s really loose—see some of the YouTube reviews. And on the Venture they finally nailed it. Not to loose, not too stiff. A joy to use, finally.', '1 inch = 2,54 cm? Yes! The laptop compartment is not stiff, quite stretchy.

The back panel on the Chimera does certainly look more sophisticated but I haven’t noticed any increase in comfort.', 'Waterproof, no. Water resistant, yes. You can add some DWR spray to give it an extra layer and it will be just as good as most of the “waterproof” bags on the market', 'Nope. The hook keeps the top flap firmly in place. As long as you’ve zippered the sides up of the bag’s body you are good. As another poster said above they have perfected the hook mechanism: not loose but not too hard to unhook. Bought the black Venture bag for office and really love the subtle look and pockets. Was using the Osprey Arcane bag 20L before and to me this was an upgrade.', ""Seems like the double price is heavily based around the specialty fabrics--bonded top grain leather to ripstop for a lightweight technical fabric that feels/looks special.\n\nI was really interested in it, but the mismatching fabrics is a moodkiller for me. If it was all leather with some accent fabrics I'd feel differently, but with the front panel being the leather and the sides/top being the paired ripstop, it's feels like a mishmash.\n\nYour photos show some significant color differences compared to the original release photoshoots."", '> I like the Chimera a lot less now and regret buying it.\nFor how much will you sell it?', ""Agree with everything you mentioned about the bag; been loving mine. My only concern is about the longevity of the hook system and whether or not the mesh loops can tolerate longterm wear. Guess we'll have to wait and see"", 'Really?

I got the blue color though.', 'I am not trying to be a hater here, but I think the double price is because it has the Carryology name and they were made in a limited supply.

Thanks!\n\nYou're welcome!"", 'The blue is a nice Color as well!!', ""I'm debating between the black and blue. Both are quite classic. Can you guys post a review of the bag soon?! Can't find many reviews on the bag yet."", ""That's kind of the same thing? Other collabs may be more around the branding/hype (I don't super follow carryology collabs), but this one probably adds a ton of production costs because they are using a custom fabric they made just for this collab. \n\nThat's small batch pricing at multiple stages of the manufacturing process."", 'Did everyone just miss the completely different backpanel?

I was gonna bite the bullet on the Workpack but saw Chase’s review on the Venture. For some reasons, I’m drawn to the Venture’s design but have never used anything like this access.', 'Will do!

Bellroy Venture Ready vs Mini Sling ?,"Title.

I recently bought a Bellroy Venture 6L sling.  I think it is great but I want to get another small sling for trips to the store and when I play gigs (I work as a gigging musician).  I have been looking at either the Venture Ready or the Mini Sling.  I would likely just keep my wallet, keys, hand sanitizer, pack of gum, and various random items (e.g., wad of cash after a gig, tickets, etc.). 

I’m leaning more towards the Venture Ready but I wanted to hear different opinions.  TIA! ","[""The venture ready has a stiffer phone sleeve divider, so if you don't need that just go with the one you prefer the looks.

Upgrading from the Bellroy Lite Sling - need more internal organizing. Pakt 5L sling?,"Hi everyone. 

I’ve been using my bellroy lite for over a year now and it’s in pretty rough shape now. I really liked how it fit and how it could stay slim without much in it and expand when needed. Looking to upgrade to something with more internal organization without breaking the bank. Ideally under 100 but willing to go over just a little bit. Here is what I am looking for. 

1. Similar size - must be able to carry more then a small sling. My carry consists of chapstick, small lighter, tiny shoe horn and AirPods in the front pocket. Main pocket has 10K power bank, lightning cable, hand sanitizer, tissue pouch, notebook, pen, floss and disposable toothbrush pouch, Invisalign case and smoking papers/weed. 

Sometimes it will include an umbrella, handheld gaming console, or a book. Probably never all at the same time. So it has to be able to fit the daily stuff with some room to spare. 

2. Organization - right now the main compartment feels like a junk drawrer. Too many loose items and no places to put them. 

So far I have only tried the TomToc T-21 xpac and while I liked that one, it could only fit everything by taking up all the empty space in the bag. 

I’m also looking at the park anywhere 5L but nervous about the size and look of the bag. How does it carry? ","[""Have you looked at the Bellroy Venture 6L? $130 retail, but the old Black color pops up on Amazon from time to time for around $100\n\n  \nI bought the Lite Sling (Mini) first and felt the same as you. Not enough organization in the Lite, just felt like a bucket. I'm very happy with the Venture 6L. It uses the same gusset system as your Lite Sling, and lays relatively flat. \n\n  \nYou mentioned a handheld gaming console. The 6L easily fits a switch. It also fits my ROG Ally, but with less wiggle room, lengthwise."", 'Love my pakt 5L anything sling!', ""I can fit a lot in my pakt 5l. I do greatly enjoy it. \n\nOne thing of note, the bag doesn't have a lot of structure due to the materials used. If you load it up with heavy things, it will look like it's sagging. I do put a lot of value into the foot print of the company that makes the products I use. If you are used to more ridged feeling bags, this probably won't be for you. \n\nMy load out it huge though and does include 2 a5 notebooks, a dice caddy and several heavy fountain pens. \n\nIf you have any more specific questions, I can happily answer them though : )"", 'Pakt 5 is great.\n\nAlso may be worth considering the Cotopaxi Allpa, Cotopaxi Coso, Evergoods Mountain Hip Pack 3.5 and the Trakke Largo!', 'Ulanzi PB008 is awesome and has good organisation.\xa0 Well made and doesnt break the bank.', 'I use the Venture 6L and absolutely love it. Fantastic organization and even fits my Purist 18oz bottle with ease.', 'Thank you I’ll look into that one!', 'Thanks for your feedback. I don’t need my bags to have structure but I don’t like when they look lumpy when packed full. Is that how the Pakt looks?', 'Thanks. I’ll check those out.', ""The front pocket very much so has its own space, so anything from the primary pocket won't poke out of the front of the bag. \n\nIf you load the front pocket out with chunkier items, it does have the potential to be lumpy. Knowing what I keep there(sheathed multitool, Nail kit, power bank, med case, ear buds, inhaler, phone stand and masks) everything fits well with a bit of space around it on all sides. Enough room to still rummage around and get the items or throw a beanie in there. You can't see any hard lines from the items. If I were to put more in there, it would create a visible outline though. While the material is a high quality and has stood the test of time for me, it is a thinner feeling material. To liken it to something most people have had an experience with, the fabric on a standars jansport bag is probably a good comparison."", 'Gotcha. Thank you so much for all the info. I might pull the trigger since it’s on sale right now too.', 'For $50 on sale and your okayness without the hard structure that you would find in other bags, it really is tough to beat.', ""If it's still on clearance, get it, you (probably) won't regret it.

Is the Bellroy Transit Workpack too big?,"It has almost the same dimensions of the Venture Pack, but 6 litters less. It has bigger dimensions than the Alpaka Elements Pro (26L). 

I’m very confused by how brands measure their bags differently.

My only concern with buying the transit is that it might be too big. I travel a lot, but I carry just a few things in my daily routine (really, just a laptop, water bottle, perhaps a small notebook, hair product, toothbrush, and maybe a small point and shoot camera). Would the bag feel weird being that empty?

","[""I can only say I have the transit 20L and it's a very nice backpack.\xa0\n\n\nNo doubt with your daily load it will have space available - useful to me if you pick up some shopping on the way home or want to take a rain coat/extra layer, or want to use the pack for another purpose.\n\n\nIt definitely wont feel overly empty - there is enough structure to it to prevent that."", ""No, I have that bag and what you've said is pretty much my daily carry. I carry:\n- laptop\xa0\n- chargers, one laptop one phone\xa0\n- headset for work\n- cutlery set\xa0\n- notebook or two\n- water bottle\xa0\n\n\nAnd then accessories like hand san, a glasses cleaning cloth, a claw clip for my hair in the zip mesh pocket in the main compartment of the bag.\n\n\nIt's got a perfect pocket for your purse/wallet in the front, and I put my pens there too.\n\n\nBellroy are weird with their sizing, I'd say it's smaller than advertised. I've also got the matador beast18 and it holds similar, but obviously in a different way.\xa0\n\n\nI like the transit workpack because I live in Scotland and can fit a big waterproof jacket in it if I need.\xa0\n\n\nThe one thing I will say is that if you load it out too much it looks bulky - my work pal once said I look like a teenage mutant ninja turtle. The bag is green so don't think that will help my case!\xa0\n\n\nBut no, like ecoli said there's a lot of structure on it, so it wont ever feel too empty. I like it as a daily carry. Love the organisation, I keep a lot of things in it constantly so I don't need to think about taking them with me. It's got the classic bellroy strap slipping issue, so it's better if you have not many things in it, so I'd say give it a go if you're interested!""]","[2, 1]","['2024-04-12 09:16:55', '2024-04-12 11:26:43']",1,2024-04-12 08:39:32

It is what it is."", 'Quick update: inquired regarding the warranty and was granted a replacement by Bellroy in a very hassle free manner!', 'This was called ""biscuit"" on the order confirmation, but probably Terracotta.

They state which of their cases aren't real leather, e.g. the 'bio cases' for iPhone 14s, but these aren't a thing for the Pixels."", ""Sorry, but you're gonna need to back that up with some evidence if you're suggesting they're lying about using leather."", ""Nice! I thought they may honour it. It's not like you directly caused the damage. We need to hold companies to their warranties so they make their products more durable. And while bellroy cases look damn nice, they could definitely have a sturdier build."", ""Absolutely nowhere did I say they lied. Some of the information is on their website. Different leathers, different types and durability depending on the colours and totally different dying techniques. They also use materials in some cases that are plant based, so, not leather.  Not sure how consistent they are in telling the customer what type they are buying. You need to cross reference what you are buying and in what colour with the materials information page if you wanted to be closer to being sure. This has all changed depending on the year and the cases and when I have read their website but previous pages aren't all there any more.\n\nI like their cases but some aren't as durable as a leather good should be imo and that top layer of leather and or dye can be incredibly fragile and indeed scrape off in some cases."", ""True that. Main reason i didn't even look into it was that I'm too used to companies presenting everything as the customer's fault. So yeah, nice experience for a change, especially since I didn't hide the scuffs that were indeed caused by a fall (but again made worse in the first place because the leather is too soft)."", ""You said they're 'stretching the definition of leather'. A material is either leather or not leather - there's no in between in that. \n\nYou're right in that [all the information is on their page](https://bellroy.com/our-materials). All Pixel cases for the 7 and 6 have been real leather (I can't say for any others as I was never in the market for one before the 6), they're just **treated** slightly differently depending on the colour, but this doesn't change the fact they're still leather.\n\nAnd yes, bellroy works with heaps of different materials, including plant-based, but they are very clear in a product's description what material is being used - they're very transparent about this. In the Pixel cases, once again, that material is **leather**.

Bellroy Sling vs Mini,"I wnat to buy bellroy sling or sling mini. I know that venture and lite slings are more practical, but i care about looks only. I just want to know can mini fit ipad mini 6, or Nintendo switch oled (with joycons on).
P. S. Can anyone tell me real dimensions? because different sites provide different specs.
P. P. S. Can anyone show me how really slate color bellroy sling looks?","['The mini felt really dam small. Like barely pocket reliever small.', '**As a Nintendo Switch OLED user and iPad mini 6 user, I can tell you this, hope it helps:**\n\nI have and I been tried most of the regular range Bellroy slings and those are my thoughts. \n\nBellroy Regular Sling: Can hold both, even the Nintendo Switch with the Joy-Cons on, even with a Supcase Pro Case with front cover. The style on this one is the best for any kind of outfit, I heavily recommend Melbourne Black or Navy, they can match any outfit. \n\nBellroy Sling Mini: It can hold a Nintendo Switch but with the Joy-Cons unattached, and some other stuff, but the zipper to the main compartment is a little bit narrow and you\'ll struggle a little bit to put it ir on out. It won\'t fit an iPad mini 6, even without case, the form factor doesn\'t work very fine with the Mini so maybe you need to forget this one. Just as the regular Sling, the design and color variety looks soooo good with any outfit and looks just casual. \n\nBoth of the Regular Sling and Sling Mini have a nice and stiff ""seatbelt"" like strap, and its very comfortable and durable.\n\nBellroy Lite Sling Mini: Can hold the Switch with the Joy-Cons off and the iPad mini 6, but you won\'t have any room left for nothing but a little wallet, and it\'ll be heavy AF. Like it, but the ripstop fabric looks a little bit technical and maybe you\'ll struggle to match your outfit. \n\nBellroy Lite Sling: Can hold both, even the Nintendo Switch with the Joy-Cons on, even with a Supcase Pro Case with front cover and still have room for other stuff. The only CON is due to the weight, the strap won\'t be very comfortable, but it can holds everything without problem. Same as the Lite Sling Mini, the ripstop fabric looks technical and maybe you\'ll struggle to match your outfit. But is extremely useful if you use it for traveling because its waterproof and packable, so you can roll it up and put it inside your backpack or luggage.\n\nVenture Sling 7L and 9L, they can hold up everything and even much much more, but the size its too big for daily usage, at least for me. And the design is extremely technical. The ruggedness on those one and the quality of the materials are very impressive, but if you prefer design over anything else, maybe you won\'t like them a lot.\n\nQuick personal conclusion: \n\nIf you care a lot about the design, color, and matching outfit, the regular Bellroy Sling will be awesome for you. \n\nIf you prefer something more lightweight and packable if you travel a lot, the Lite Sling will be better for you. \n\n**Bonus:**\n\nAfter reading a lot of the TomToc Sling 4.5L I decided to try it, and it can hold both, the strap is very comfortable and good organization, you can put other stuff on it with both inside and you\'ll be fine. Very functional but TBH and IMO, after being a Bellroy Sling user for years, this one feels cheap and looks like a budget sling, even with the Cordura Nylon and YKK zippers, the materials used on this sling feels flimsy and cheap, is very nice to use on everyday due to the inner organization but I cannot stand against the cheap looking and I just didn\'t like it how it looks with my outfit so after some days I decided to go back to Bellroy, the materials looks and feels way better. I recommend the TomToc Sling if you\'re on a budget and if you don\'t care about fashion lol. \n\n**About Colors:**\n\nI bought only two colors for my slings: Blue or Black. \n\nThe blackest color on Bellroy current sling lineup is the one Called Melbourne Black, this one is full black, nothing else. The inner compartment is like gray/light brown, there\'s another called ""Slate"" but it looks like a washed black of a very obscure grey. \n\nThe Navy Color on the current lineup is sooo nice, just navy with light grey straps, this one is my favorite. \n\nI hope this helps you, if you have another question, feel free to make it, I\'ll be happy to answer. \n\nI\'m currently using the Venture Ready Sling 2.5L for my daily stuff, only phones, AirPods and wallet, and it looks cool, I didn\'t mentioned this one because it cannot hold an iPad mini 6, it can holds a Nintendo Switch OLED but with the Joy-Cons unattached, so it won\'t be useful for you.\n\nFor traveling I\'m using the Lite Sling, I don\'t love the materials, but is very useful because it can hold a lot, have a easy access compartment and it\'s packable, so I can just roll it on my backpack or luggage and it weight almost nothing.', 'i have a mini and without measuring i can tell u it wont fit a ipad mini or switch. its a rather small sling but can get pretty deep when u start packing it rather than tall. u are looking at an internal height of 12-13cm at maximum.', 'Thanks for the comment. \nWhat color do you have? And can you tell me dimensions?', 'Hey there, I hope you don’t mind me asking but I’m looking to purchase a Bellroy sling for use on holiday, therefore the items will be things such as my phone, glasses etc basically things to keep my pockets empty so nothing massively big. Which sling would you say is the most comfortable and would recommend?', ""Thank you for your detailed response. I bought  venture 9l on ebay for a very cheap 40$ and it's new. But i care more about style and I'm still considering buying regular sling 7l or 4l (maybe 7l). I'm interested in slate color. I'm from Georgia (not the USA) and 100$ is a lot of money here, i can't afford it. So I'll wait for a better price. But colors... I wish the slate color was just like on pictures"", ""That's too bad. So you suggest i should probably go for a 7l variant? What color do you have? Because people in reviews say that colors didn't match pictures"", 'Hello! Of course, I’ll be glad to answer. Well if you’re looking for a compact sling specially from Bellroy, I can recommend you three of their current Sling Lineup, i tried all of them and just like you, i dont carry too much stuff on my slings, only de essentials.  \n\nThe normal kind of stuff I put it on my slings are my two phones, car keys, AirPods, my Vaper and my wallet. \n\nBellroy Sling Mini\nOne of my favorites, and it was the first ever mini sling introduced by Bellroy, the capacity is around 3 liters, it have a front pocket, and a center pocket with a little pocket inside with zipper and microfiber for stuff like sunglasses. I like this one because the design is casual, you can put everything on it and it haves an expandable gusset, this one is the most casual and outfit friendly one. It’s a good sling, but I personally think it doesn’t have any kind of organization and all your stuff just go wandering inside, you can put a little water bottle on it and it expands a lot. Another little drawback for me is the opening of the main pocket, I find it a little bit narrow for stuff like a water bottle. There’s a lot of color options with this one, from a classic black to a orange color. Also the straps on this one are like seatbelt and is very confortable.\n\nBellroy Sling Lite\nThis one is a good choice if you don’t want to spend lots of money and you wanna literally take it anywhere. It’s made of a very thin but sturdy and lightweight ripstop fabric. I like this one because its very light for the everyday usage, even for traveling, you can fold it of roll it and put it inside your backpack or luggage. It have a front zipper without organization with a key loop and thats all. The main pocket have a very wide opening zipper so you can put stuff like an iPad Mini, it packs water resistant zippers and the material is very resistant to moisture, so you can take it practically anywhere, this is my choice for traveling, everything fits perfect, the only thing that i don’t like a lot is the lack of organization, on the main pocket it only have a very little pocket for thinks like key, and another zipper pocket for stuff like glasses. The inner organization is similar to the Mini but the form factor makes it very easy to put stuff inside of it. It’s equipped with a nice lightweight strap with a magnetic buckle. It can expands a lot and you can put water bottles in it if you need. This one have a more technical design and the color variety is limited to white, yellow and black. \n\nBellroy Venture Ready Sling 2.5L\nThis is my favorite sling and my personal sling lately, this one is smaller than the other two so, this is a pick for only the essentials, you cannot pack a lot of stuff in comparison with the other two, but it haves way more organization and pockets and thats the stuff I like the most. The front pocket have two divisions where you can put your earphones, car keys, pills of whatever you need, everything stays on its site, and it have a key loop on this front pocket. The main pocket have tree sections, a padded sleeve for your smartphone, a main area for most of your stuff and a mesh sleeve for your glasses. Also, it haves a back pocket for slim stuff such as cash, passport, notebook or a slim wallet. This one is my favorite, the material is reinforced nylon, so it can withstand any kind of situation, also have water resistant zippers. The design of this one is more intended for outdoors, but after I’ve been using, you can use it with whatever you want. It is available on green, orange, black and navy blue, all colors looks nice.', 'when fitting the devices inside is really important for u then the bigger version is a must i suppose as sad as it is coz i think the design gets a little awkward with bigger sizes. although the design overall needs some getting used to with the zipper placements ig hahah   \ndont get me wrong its an awesome sling overall and i love how it carries !  \ni have charcoal, the colour isnt available anymore but its true to the pics at least idk about the other ones i only ever saw black and charcoal and they were as advertised.', 'In your experience would you say the venture ready 2.5L could fit a Nintendo switch?', ""I know that it's impractical. I have Tomtoc 4.5l sling. It's an awesome sling. Organization is perfect, fits everything i need. But it doesn't look good with some of my outfits. That's why i want to buy Bellroy."", ""Hi! I actually tried and it depends, the full console with the joy cons attached doesn't fit. But you can put the tablet on the phone compartment and it fits quite nice and with padding, you'll need to put the joy cons apart on the main compartment of in the front pocket. I hope this help you."", 'i feel that haha basically the reason i have the mini sometimes u just need to look a little better than just being practical haha   \n\n\nmaybe [waterfield](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/crossbody-bags) has some other fitting options for u. i would they they have a nice professionell look.  \nor maybe [trakke](https://trakke.co.uk/).', 'Very much does.

I’m looking at these for a possible carryon bag.', 'Thanks for the tips my friend. I like Waterfield variants. Trakke?... Well largo sling looks like a gypsy carrying a baby and the brand name means butt in Georgian hahaha...', 'hahahaha i was looking at their Handa sling it may fit an ipad mini although i am not sure', ""Didn't like it, too purse-ish.

Able Carry Plus // Bellroy Transit Workpack,"Hello everyone!

I need some insight to see if I'm making the right choice between the Able carry plus and the Bellroy Transit Workpack 20L (both in the green colour)

I currently have the Bellroy and have 2 main concerns:
- the warranty that comes with the Bellroy, from which I read, isn't what it should be? And would be better with Able Carry?
- the size of the water bottle pockets. It's really frustrating to get a bottle in or out the pockets without having to take out the laptop from the laptop compartment.

The thing I do like from the Bellroy is the accessories pocket with the laptop compartment. It's nice to be able to take the laptop + charger and mouse out in one go.

Did anyone face a similar choice and, what made you chose one or the other?

Thank you all for your time! It's my first 'expensive' backpack and I'm really looking forward to your opinions!","[""The able carry doesn't have a separate laptop compartment.  I have a tomtoc slim pouch that has my charger and mouse and just pull that out when I pull my laptop out.  My laptop does take a 180w charger though, but I would think the same process can work with a smaller charger.  I do know that the nomads nation said the Bellroy looked larger then the rated 20 L and it watching the video I agree that it looks larger then my daily plus.  \n\nI'm personally thinking of also ordering a Aer Lunar pack from ministry of supply. It has a lot of similar features like the external access water bottle pocket, it also has a top pocket and a separate laptop compartment.  I still intend to keep my daily plus and honestly will probably order a thirteen daybag at some point."", ""Thanks for your answer! What do you think about the Able Carry? Is it difficult to get the laptop out of the bag since it doesn't have a separate laptop compartment?"", ""I don't have an issue but I have a small packout and the vast majority of the time, I don't even need my backpack because I drive in and we have desktops.  The laptop is only for travel and wfh and I can fit my full pack out in an Aer Pro Pack Slim, which does have difficulty getting the laptop out because the edges of it touch shell of the bag.  The daily plus has room to move my laptop in.  Personally I've tried two bags that are 21L and under with a separate laptop compartment and 2 without.  I don't feel I personally need it to be separate.  If I were one bag traveling and going into a meeting with part of my bag having a packing cube, when I would want a separate access.\n\nOf the 4 bags i've tried since october I'm keeping my daily plus, I really want to keep my pro pack slim but will probably selll that one.""]","[3, 1, 1]","['2024-02-01 15:21:43', '2024-02-01 16:30:33', '2024-02-02 00:51:49']",2,2024-02-01 13:38:02
Bellroy Slim Sleeve standard vs premium?,"Hi all, looking to upgrade to a vertical bifold and interested in the bellroy slim sleeve. I noticed they have a “premium” version that costs $40 more and uses “dri-tan”. Can anyone speak to the quality of premium leather using this method and if it is truly worth spending the additional money (50% more expensive than standard)?

Budget is not an issue as I’d like to use this for the long term. Thanks!","['Thank you for posting to r/EDC! \n\nIf your post contains an image of your gear, a list is still required.

Bellroy Systems Work Bag $120 FS Nordstrom Rack,"The Bellroy Systems Work Bag is on sale for $120. Pretty good price. FS from Nordstrom Rack. Would not expect this to last.

If you are not familiar, this is a pretty well regarded work bag. A couple things to note:

\-It does look like a tote a lot of times, so might not be the easiest look to pull off.

\-I believe this is no zipper up top but rather a fold/magnet type of closure

\-The strap is reprotedly pretty nice

\-For those in the market for this bag or type of bag, this is a pretty nice price for it.

Rainproofing in Bellroy Backpacks,"Many of you may have seen [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/13htm6v/rain_test_video_bellroy_venture_ready_26l_pack/) showing the terrible rainproofing performance of Bellroy's Venture Ready 26 L. Does anyone know if this problem exists for other Bellroy bags, particularly their backpacks? I've read that the Venture Ready was made with a lighter weight fabric than their other lines, so it might be a fluke.

I know Bellroy is somewhat overpriced and it has shady practices re:Carryology, but there are very few brands that are that functional while also looking so darn good. I'm looking at their Transit Backpack right now, but definitely won't buy it if it's rainproofing is just as bad.","['I really love(d) that pack because of look, feel, structure, comfort, etc. But I need a lot of water resistance, and when I wrote and asked them about it, this is what they said: ""About the water resistance, I can confirm that it\'s indeed layered with Durable Water Resistant (DWR) coating. Its main purpose is to protect your bag from splashes of water or light rain and can stand wear and tear and won\'t change its water resistance over time."" So yeah, ""splashes"" and ""light rain""--kudos to them for not saying ""it can handle a downpour!"" There are a ton of packs that are way more water resistant than this and other Bellroys, but if your true concern is  maximal water resistance, get a rain cover. It always helps to have great water resistance UNDER a rain cover (as well as on the back of the pack, which the cover doesn\'t cover), but a cover will handle 95% of your weather issues just fine.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/xn5d2w/bellroy_bags_vs_wet_weather/iptoxif/\n\n/u/Mr_MAlvarez', 'PS--In that video, it looks like some of the water came in through the zippers, but it\'s not super clear. If it did get in through the zippers, there\'s not much you can do: they\'re YKK AquaGuard, though they\'re the ""glossy"" rather than the ""matte"" version, which might make some difference. YKK does make true waterproof zippers, but damn, they look like gears on a machine or something--a totally different beast than what\'s seen on a regular backpack. If it\'s not the zippers, it\'s obviously the fabric, stitching, seams, etc. If you want better resistance in fabrics, at least, go for X-Pac or ULTRA.

Hi,

I'm considering getting this Bellroy Via Workpack for my M3 MacBook Pro 16 inch, but my biggest concern about the bag is that the mesh pocket inside the main compartment seems to be located so high that its zipper might scratch my MacBook.

(MacBook Pro 16"" is so big that it shouldn't be fully covered by the laptop pocket in the main compartment.)

If there's anyone who tried this bag, could you confirm that the zipper of the mesh pocket is located lower than the top of the laptop pocket?","['Here\'s what it looks like with my 15"" Macbook Air:\n\n[https://imgur.com/28WuOLR](https://imgur.com/28WuOLR)\n\nOverall it\'s a very solid bag, and the best EDC backpack I\'ve owned.

Bellroy transit work pack feels heavy,"As title says.

Just picked up a 20l bellroy transit work pack on sale. Was previous using bellroy tote pack 20l and an Incase Icon backpack. 

 I’m not sure why, but this backpack feels so much heavier when filled up. Feel it just carrying in my hands and much worse on my back. Using the same edc i normally carry in my Incase backpack, it feels substantially lighter.

14inch MacBook Pro 
Sony wh-1000 m4

Aer or Bellroy for college?,"Soooo Im looking for a bag for college and life after college and I am completely torn between some bags. The biggest contenders I Have currently are the AER city pack and city pack pro, And for Bellroy the classic and Transit work pack. 

These are very different bags but like I said im currently completely torn on which to pick. It can even be an entirely different company but these are the biggest ones recommended to me. All I carry on me everyday is basic stuff, notebook, folder, water bottle, over the head headphones, small pencil case, 13.6 laptop, wallet, keys, Simply just everyday stuff. 

The problem is that im not sure if my carry capacity will ever have to increase, I could be a commuter student or situations arise where extra space would be nice to have but its not a guarantee.

"Toilet paper capacity comparison of Bellroy Transit 28L, Bellroy Transit 20L and Dragonfly ULA","This is just a toilet paper capacity comparison of Bellroy Transit 28L, Bellroy Transit 20L and Dragonfly ULA.

The toilet papers used were the Charmin Ultra Soft rolls.

The Bellroy Transit 20L could hold only 5 rolls.

The Dragonfly ULA could hold 6 rolls but this wasn't factoring the additional 8 liter pcokets on the side.

The Bellroy Transit 28L could hold 6 rolls comfortably.

Just thought someone might find it useful because for me it was very difficult to tell the capacity just by looking at the marketing videos or by watching other videos.

Overall very impressed with the capacity of the Dragonfly ULA. That said, it is listed as a 30L but it's hard to get a sense of how much it can really hold because ULA includes the Dragonfly's side pockets within its specs.

The video of the capacity comparisons can be viewed here:

Tennis balls would be better and ping pong balls (38mm) would approach the ASTM standard using 20mm balls. The larger the unit of measurement, the less that the small nooks and crannies can be included. You start to get into the efficiency of a particular proportion (like playing Tetris).\n\nIf you go by external measurements, the Dragonfly would fit into a 25 liter box and the Bellroy Transit would need a 36 liter box.

City Travel Daily Carry Bag - Bellroy Venture Sling Questions,"Hey, I have an upcoming trip where I will be visiting some cities in Europe and I am looking for a bag to carry around with me while exploring. I already have a larger bag for clothes and stuff, so this bag would just be for carrying during the day. The kind of things I would be looking to carry are:

* Phone
* Wallet
* Kobo Libra 2 (ereader)
* Water bottle
* Battery pack + cable
* Earbuds case
* Hand sanitiser
* Tissues

I also wouldn't mind a bit more space for other bits and pieces or small bits of shopping (but a small packable tote may be better).

Having done some research, I think I like the idea of a sling over a backpack, unless anyone can convince me otherwise. The one that has jumped out to me most so far is the [Bellroy Venture Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-sling-6l?color=ranger_green&material=baida_nylon&size=6l). However, I have not been able to find any information about the size of the pockets inside the large compartment of the bag! I contacted support but they seemed to have misunderstood me, and just sent me the dimensions of the full bag. I haven't heard back from them yet after my follow up email. Does anybody know the dimensions of the internal pockets of the Venture Sling? I'd like to know the sizes of both the 6L and the 9L variants.

Alternatively, if anyone thinks a different bag would suit my needs better, I'd be happy to take any suggestions. Thanks!

Bellroy Storm Gray Premium venture Sling vs 6L venture ,Does anyone have the premium Bellroy Venture sling? I’m wondering how the color and leather are holding up in the storm gray color.

Oh, and the regular Sling is 7L while the Venture Sling is 6L, 9L, or 10L (camera edition only).\n\nThere are other differences as well, but I\'m just pointing out that you\'re looking at two different sling designs, not just material differences.']",[2],['2024-05-08 12:41:17'],2,2024-05-08 00:02:47

Able Carry Daily Plus vs Bellroy Venture Ready 26,"I recently purchased the AER Pro Pack 24L and it’s almost the perfect bag. I was looking for a black bag with good material that I could beat to hell and has great pockets for storage. It is exactly that. My only gripe is that if packed out and filled, it looks like a turtle shell.

I worked in the live music industry so I sometimes bring a change of clothes/shoes for longer days. My EDC items are my water bottle, a Peak Designs Tech Case, a Patagonia Black Hole 3L pouch for travel sized toiletries, MacBook Pro, and iPad. Which bag do you guys think would be better? ACDP or Bellroy Venture Ready?","['I recently just did a review of the Bellroy Venture Ready 26, its quite similar in size and design to the Able Carry DayBreaker 2. I havent had a chance to try the Daily plus yet but its only 21L as mentioned which is a fair bit smaller than the 26L', 'Having the same questions as well so following for any recommendations from others.\n\nI felt the same way about CPP. Love all of the features but really not liking its aesthetics (especially when fully packed out).\n\nI was considering the venture ready 26 but wasn’t sure about Bellroy’s QC and for a bag of that price not having a longer warranty is a deal breaker.\n\nI think for the daily plus, it’s really neat but seems a little bit small at 21L which is my only gripe.\n\nI think potential other options to consider might be the CHZ26 or if you’d like more organization, the CTB26. The latter potentially being a bit large for a daily carry. But perfect if you’ve got a ton of stuff. \n\nSo really with all of that being said I’m also in a bit of a rut deciding between bags! Haha.', 'I have the Able Carry Daily Plus which i love so much. AMA if you have questions about the Able Carry. In terms of volume its more of a 20ish L rather than 21L.', 'I like Able Carry, but their Daily and Daily Plus backpacks definitely have a round like shape that you could argue would make you look like a turtle. The Venture is a squarer backpack.', 'Some people done the comparison that the daily plus and venture ready is actually more similar in size since bellroy is quite generous with their math 😅', 'I ended up ordering the Able Carry late last night. I watched every review I could find on each of the bags and like the ACDP better. Also, like you said, the price point for the Bellroy is steep especially with the lack of long-term warranty.', 'But nice to know someone is in the same boat as me!', 'How’s the height if you had to squish it to fit 40cm sizer?', ""Yeah, returned a Bellroy Venture Ready 26. My guess: they include the capacity of the sidepocket in their 26l, even though it eats into the main compartment. Therefore that calculation makes pretty much zero sense.\n\nBut: If the pack itself had just more rigidity and structure, I think it would've been my perfect EDC bag. Absolutely love the look of it, when somewhat packed out. Emtpy it is another thing entirely."", ""Thanks for letting me know! I'm definitely swinging the Able Carry side right now all things considered about the Venture. Though I think I'm going to hold out and hope that they make a slightly larger version of the Daily Plus, or even a smaller version of the Max. Would be perfect if they had a 24L size that's more meant for every day!"", 'Honestly love my ACDP. Personally, I still think it looks great when packed out. The way the bag is structured, it looks about the same empty as it does packed.', 'What back did you end up with?', 'This! A 24l AC Max would be perfection!', 'Good to know! Would you say it’s a true 21L or is it a little more? Judging by every video I’ve watched, it looks to be more than 21L.', 'Given this sub it should come as no surprise - I got the Evergoods CPL 24, a bit later the AC Daily Plus and just recently bought a perfect condition used Bellroy Venture Ready 26 because I did very much like it. I use that for day trips with the family.', 'I agree! Not sure if it’s in their pipeline, but I actually ended up going with an Alpha One Niner Whitley. Weirdly, though rated 4 Liters less, it holds just as much as the CPL24 while being more comfortable. So no regrets from me!', ""I wouldn't know as I have nothing to compare it to. But I will say I packed two days of clothes, including a non-squishable bra and jeans, and I still had room in the front pocket for other things if I needed it. Surprisingly spacious."", 'Nice! Why the Bellroy Venture Ready 26 over the Evergoods CPL 24?\n\nWould it work okay as a gym/work day bag?', ""Yeah I have ordered both the Evergoods CPL24 and AC Daily Plus and I think I will keep the ACDP. I just like it better in terms of size and aesthetics. The external quick access is easier to reach for me and the key loop being there instead of the top pocket (CPL24) makes more sense. The ACDP is definitely smaller and I won't be able to what I wanted: have a bag for daily work EDC + gym directly after work. I was able to fit everything inside (shoes, clothes, toiletries, towel), but it was extremely tight. I have a day off tomorrow and may update my previous posts with photos of the loadout.   \nSeeing the ACDP in person it really makes me wish there was a 24l Able Carry with the same design as the Max."", 'Okay awesome. All I needed to know! Thank you!', 'CPL is perfect for more packed office days incl gym, or weekend trips when I don’t need tons of clothes and want to bring a laptop. \n\nAC Daily Plus I use for days when I just take less stuff into the office (laptop, Evergoods CAP2, 0,5l bottle). \n\nVenture Ready 26 for day trips with the family, or when I feel like it for the office (same loadout as with the ACDP). \n\n\nIs it too many bags for those use cases? Probably. Is it fun - absolutely! 😄', ""I have the CPL 24 as well! But I think I find that the AON Whitley is a bit more comfortable, and holds just as much! Which is most surprising.\n\nThough the organization of the Whitley is more similar to the CPP than it is to both the ACDP and the CPL24. Thus I think it's a bit more suited to the EDC use case.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what your loadout is!"", ""Would love to know how you like the bag once it arrives! Hope it's the one!"", 'ah so you wouldn’t use the ACDP or Venture Ready 26 for office/gym days?\n\nI’m sold on the CPL the only limiting factor is the price', 'Also you seem like an expert in exactly the bags I’ve been excited about!\n\nAny chance you have any knowledge of Aer bag for this use case?\nI’m also eyeing the Aer flight, pro pack, or city pack pro? Or even the duffel/tp3.', 'I\'ve been mulling over these 3 bags for a while now so wanted to follow up :)\n\nWhich would be the best for EDC? What do you mean by a ""more packed office day""? Curious what your load out is for each bag.\n\nIe would your ACDP work for gym clothes / shoes + tech accessories + laptop / water bottle?\n\nAny reasons you picked the Bellroy Venture Ready over the Bellroy Transit series?\n\nOn my end:\n\nI go to an office daily and a gym. I like an upright bag where it\'s easy to access contents from the side (ie from a gym locker). Ideally something not too heavy.\n\nI\'m coming from an REI rucksack 28L, so maybe all the above will be a better option.', 'alright it’s here and it’s really, really special. there’s so much room. i had a time or two where i was thinking “alright where can this go?” then i’d find another pocket. honestly, it seems bigger than 21L IMO. i have it pretty packed out and don’t feel it on my back at all. i used the water bottle pocket for glasses cases and put my 20oz owala in the main compartment. iPad and MacBook fit well in the sleeves.', 'I’ll for sure update you', 'Yeah, the CPL is (too) expensive imho. Quality is fantastic, but at a certain point you have to admit that there are other bag manufacturers that offer similar quality for a more affordable price (i.e. hiking bags etc). But yeah, this opinion may not be shared by all, of course. And EG stuff is fantastic also in terms of layout, hence why I splurged. \n\n\nVR 26 can definitely be used for work and gym, if you don’t carry a massive load for either use. A 13“ laptop, a smaller tech pouch, a bottle, gym shoes, shirt+shorts, socks, underwear and a towel pretty much max it out. \n\n\nCPL24 doesn’t hold that much more tbh, but the separate laptop compartment helps. I feel my gear is better protected. So I would chose this over the VR26.\n\n\nADCP is too small for this loadout. I made it work as a test, but it was cumbersome.', 'Nope, sorry I‘ve never even held an Aer product in hands. But feel free to shoot any questions you habe regarding the three I have.', 'ACDP can(!) work for that loadout. But it will be very tight. \n\n\nCPL24 and Venture Ready can be accessed from the side by opening just the zipper on one side and depending on shoe size etc can be fine for that use case. \n\n\nVenture Ready over Transit Workpack (which I tried but returned), because I found the VR26 to be more comfortable and I LOVE the top compartment for wallet, small pouch etc. Best I ever saw in a bag tbh. Also I find it more aesthetically pleasing. But that is very personal. Only downside to that bag is the laptop sleeve that is in the main compartment and not a seperate one. \n\n\nMy daily office loadout:\n- MacBook Air 13“\n- Civic Access Pouch 2\n- Small pouch for knife, bandaids, tweezers, etc\n- 0,6l Refillable Water Bottle\n- Wallet, AirPods\n- Nano Bag\n\n\nAt the end of the day, all 3 bags are great, the ACDP being the smallest of all. But again, I really like the look and style, thats why I bought it additionally. Great for non-office days around town. I feel the CPL24 or the VR26 would suit your use case better than the ACDP. In the end it comes down to actual loadout and personal preference. \n\n\nHope this helped :-)', ""I am so happy you're happy with it. I love this bag. It just feels so good to pack and wear. Kinda magic."", ""Hello there would you mind letting us know how you're feeling about the bag 2 months later?

Bellroy transit workpack users,"I have ordered a Bellroy Transit Workpack and I am looking for packing cubes that fit inside. Does anyone who uses this 20L bag have any recommendations? I am looking ideally for one larger and one smaller cube that fit well together or 2 medium cubes that fit together. I would still like some additional space around them to pack other items. Looking for flexibility depending on the load and need.

Would also be really interested to hear if people use a sling alonsgide and store it in the bag. Is there something that fits well in the laptop accessories pocket?

Thanks.","['OP, I can’t say specifically for that bag but I tend to subscribe to changing cubes based on needs and trip vs just based on bag. This is personal, but I never bother to match a specific cube to a specific bag, I find I’m over thinking if I do this. Sometimes yes, one kind of cube doesn’t work the best. But that’s why I have a variety of cubes. But like the larger Patagonia might not be great for smaller bags since it’s got depth. Just an example. \n\nIf you’re in the reading mode, there are two articles on my site - one more general intro to packing cubes and one I just did for this scenario where I compare a few brands (it’s impossible to compare them all so I chose some favorites and well liked ones here).

Bellroy Venture Sling 9L - Overseas Trip," 

Hey everyone,  

I came here over a month ago reading through posts and comments about slings in prep for a 3 week holiday to Japan with my girlfriend.  

I ended up going with the the 9L Bellroy Venture Sling and I thought I’d come back and share my experience with it.  

First of all, I’ll just say I’d never bought a sling before but knew I needed one because the backpack I used for my last Japan trip was just too big and a bit ugly for days out exploring cities, going to small restaurants and cafes and using the crowded subways and trains.  

I was already leaning toward Bellroy because I have one of their wallets and was genuinely impressed with its minimalist design and functionality. Reviews for their slings in general seemed to be pretty positive both here and on YouTube.  

I can confidently say that the Venture absolutely converted me to using slings. I’d never really given them much thought before but after experiencing how much easier it is to organise things, how much it frees up your pockets and how much more practical they are than tote bags or packbacks I’m surprised I didn’t start using them earlier. Slings seemed to be used by almost everyone in the cities we visited and I spent quite a bit of time admiring the variety of design and sizes of what everyone else was using. I’ve started thinking about what the next sling will be that I purchase! I guess that’s my first positive endorsement for the Venture! 

So after using it for 3 weeks travelling around Japan (including a week of snowboarding), leaving our accom in the morning and not returning until after dinner, here’s my thoughts: 

**Size**  
After a bit of hesitation I ended up going with the Venture 9L over the 6L version. I wanted the 6L for the overall smaller size but having never really used a sling before, and knowing I would be basically packing for both my partner and I, I figured it would be better to have the extra space and not need it, than need it and not have it. This ended up being the right call for me and it was great peace of mind loading out for the day for both of us knowing I still had room spare for things we might pick up during our day  

**Daily Carry**  
Having the space and being out for around 12 hours at a time, I’d usually take a quite a bit to keep us covered. This is what I could comfortably pack in for a day around the city (for snowboarding I packed very little) 

Front pouch: 

* 10k mA power bank 
* 5k mA power bank 
* Small hand sanitiser
* 10cm iPhone charging cord 
* 10cm USB C charging cord 
* Coin pouch 
* Key for accommodation  

Main pouch 

* Sunnies or reading glasses in dedicated pocket 
* 390ml water bottle (I could get this to stand vertically for extra space and easy access, and still zip closed the pouch) 
* Wallet
* Moleskine pocket notebook 
* Standard size click pen  
* Passport folio  
* Partners sunglasses case  
* Kindle 
* GoPro on collapsed selfie stick  
* Earbuds (in side pouch) 
* Pocket tissue pack 
* Small packet snacks or convenience store sushi roll 
* Loose paper tickets, info sheets or receipts  
* Occasionally my phone or my partners phone  

Main pouch zip pocket  

* Bandaids  
* Sheet of paracetamol  
* Backup cash 
* Spare GoPro battery  
 

**General use experience & feedback**:

Overall, I had an incredibly good experience with this sling. I loved the amount of storage space, the organisation elements built into it, the quality of the materials and its aesthetic design. It was very easy to use and was the perfect companion for long days and nights out exploring new cities.  

I used the front pouch for things I’d want easy access to without needing to fish around too much. As I’ve seen others mention, the front pouch is a tiny bit awkward - not very deep with not much expansion either, it’s almost a bit of a tight sleeve. It didn’t really feel like there was that much I could get in there but using it for a few key items only made using it much easier. The zip was occasionally a bit difficult to open or close. The key cord in this pouch was really a godsend as it completely removed the worry I have about keys falling out of my pockets or falling out of a bag as I retrieve other things. Our accommodation keys were always in that pouch, attached to the key cord and the sling was always on my body. Simple.  

The main pouch was really were it was at for me. As someone who uses glasses and sunglasses the dedicated zip pocket above the “crush zone” was just an incredibly useful bit of design that helped me easily switch from glasses to sunnies as I went through the day without worrying too much about frames getting damaged or bent.  

This pouch is deeper than I expected, and I was surprised I could pack a 15 cm water bottle vertically and completely zip up without much of an issue. The bag expands quite a bit too as you pack in items, but because of the depth of the pouch I found myself kind of stacking my items into two layers to keep the sling as slim as possible. I found the double ended zips to be really useful, and the knots on the zips were very handy when trying to open the sling with snowboard gloves on. The pouch opens quite wide which made fishing around for or rearranging items in the pouch pretty easy   

The side pouches were useful for securely storing my earbuds, and packing in some pocket tissues, however I found the pen slots just a bit awkward to get ordinary pens in and out of - so I think I’ll look at getting a shorter sized pen for this sling.   

I used the main pouch zip pocket for a few slimmer items that I wouldn’t be using that much but needed to have on me, things like bandaids, paracetamol sheet, and extra cash I didn’t want to store in my wallet. This approach worked well enough for me because I think whatever goes in that zip pocket needs to be pretty slim or else it’ll start pushing against the side pouches.  

In terms of the using the sling more generally, I found the metal quick release buckles one of my favourite things about it. It was coming out of winter in Japan and I was regularly wearing a thick hooded jacket that made taking the sling off over my head a bit cumbersome, with the strap getting caught on the hood and collar. Being able to unclip one end and slide the strap off made it infinitely easier when navigating small and crowded places like train carriages, cafes and restaurants. I’m sure it saved many people getting accidentally elbowed by me! 

On some heavily packed days it does get pretty wide, but even on normal days I found it just a bit too big regularly wear across my front torso, so I wore it tight across my back. I think it looks best that way. It was easy enough though to slide round to my front when sitting down in a train carriage.  

After 3 weeks of use I did find my shoulder and back getting a little bit sore, but I think that’s less an issue with the sling and more just to do with the amount I was packing and the long days with it on. The good thing though is that the double zips on the main pouch allowed me to flip it across my other shoulder and still get in and out of it pretty easily.  

Being out on the slopes during a couple of days of heavy snowfall the sling’s water resistance was very welcome. Aside from some snow getting in from when I unzipped, moisture was well and truly kept out.  

On durability, I’ll say that I’m still a beginner snowboarder and had more than a few stacks. Aside from a bit of scuffing on one of the metal clips the bag held up well with no damage to anything else after falling onto it or basically skidding on it. It really is a great quality product.    


And that’s basically my thoughts on the Venture sling! I really loved this, it made everything about the trip so much easier. Visually appealing and fantastic functional design. Absolutely would recommend to anyone looking for something that can comfortably accommodate their EDC along with extra space for a partner’s of friend’s gear, and space for some larger items you might need on longer days out and about.","['Good write up, thanks for sharing!\n\nI currently use a Lite Sling 7L, and while the size is a good balance of capacity and daily comfort, I’m super curious about a 9L for an upcoming 5 day trip.\n\nHard to quit using slings once you try, eh?', 'Any concerns about the lack of weather sealing? I skipped the venture sling because of the holes on the side scared me. Any concerns?', 'Great review. I felt the same about slings. Once you get one you fall into the rabbit hole. My first sling was Aer day sling 3, it was great but realized I needed more room. Ended up getting venture 6L. It was great till I realized I actually need more room esp in summer (need lots of water) so I wished I got the 9L venture sling instead. I still feel weird about slightly “open gap” on the sides of the sling even when fully closed, still minor but weird lol.', 'I love the lite sling for traveling, as a smaller female.  I bought and returned a 6L venture sling, but the fabric was too stiff and heavy for me.  \n\nI just bought the new 2.5 L Venture ready sling, and it’s perfect for every day.  It holds keys, AirPods, phone, sunglasses, lipbalm, and wallet.  It holds a little less than the 4L, but it is better organized.', 'Does the strap get painful? Looks really thin so I’ve avoided it', 'Thanks for that great review ! \nWhat do you guys think about using it to carry a 32x14x3 cm keyboard, while the venture 9L is exactly 32 cm long (12.6 inch)? I guess the bag can extend a bit but would it make it so tight I cannot put anything else inside (headphones, a paperback, small bottle, snacks, etc) or very unpractical? Does anyone have experience with fitting long but slim object in it?', 'Hey OP, Thanks for write up. I’m in the same predicament as you with one of the posts above. I’ve got a 9L Venture but looking at the 7L lite or 6L venture as a smaller bag for when I don’t need much stuff. Just wondering if you settled for one or the other or just rocking the 9L?', 'How easy is it to pull GoPro out and put back it? Is it a tight fit length wise (I have 3-way grip so overall it is 27cm with the camera or 10,5 inches)? I am choosing between 9L and 6 L.', 'About the strap buckles. Yours is made of metal right? Why there are posts that say it’s made of plastic. Is it the smaller versions? \n\nOn Amazon I read one reviewer saying made of plastic and one in aluminium. The 9l version. I am confused.', 'Would a 6l fit a 600ml hydroflash? Cant decide between the 6 and 9l… mostly for everyday use', 'Very hard. I spent a few hours yesterday just watching review videos on YouTube. \n\nThe 9L is too large to be a daily use sling for me but I think it’s perfect for those bigger, or longer days out. I’ll definitely be using this on bush walks where I need a large water bottle, snacks, camera - alongside a general EDC. For roaming around cities in Japan it was also great because I could comfortably fit my GoPro with it attached to the selfie stick and not be struggling for space. \n\nFunny you should mention the 7L Lite Sling! I’ve been eyeing that one off as my next buy. Tossing up between that and the Venture 6L but still a bit undecided. Anything things to be aware of with the Lite?', 'Oddly I didn’t find any issues with those gaps, even in the snow! When it’s fully zipped up the gaps are sort of protected because the closed zip forms a sort of roof over it. Its hard to describe but the gaps are sort of folded away a few centimetres underneath the zip. \n\nI didn’t get caught in a much rain but I think this would protect it from water getting in.', ""I use it everyday in rainy southern sweden, it's never been an issue."", 'Haha I think I’ve started at the other end of the journey. Got a large 9L which will have me set for big days out but now I’m looking for a smaller one to use on shorter or smaller trips out where I just need to empty my pockets and store a few extra small things - I’ve been considering the Aer Day Sling actually \n\nBut then I realise I also need something a bit larger too for if I want to take my Kindle with me so I’ve been looking at the 6L Venture and Lite sling too! Absolutely a rabbit hole!', 'Oh I’ve been interested in checking out the 2.5L. I’ve only seen one brief review video, so I’m waiting for more to come out to get a better idea of what it’s like. \n\nI was considering the 4L sling mini but like you said the 2.5 looks better organised, and the mini main pouch seems difficult to get in and out of. \n\nAside from the fabric, what else do you like about the Lite over the Venture 6L? I’m also tossing up between those two for a mid sized sling', 'It didn’t for me! Wearing it all day the only issue would be come the effect of the weight of the sling, but that really only happened toward the end of my trip after a solid 2 weeks of using it every single day. \n\nThe strap itself felt pretty comfortable to me. It didn’t dig in to my shoulder or anything like that', 'Currently working through that issue at the moment! I’m still looking for a small alternative as the 9L is definitely too big for just the local day trips by myself. I use it because that’s the only thing that will fit my iPad mini/kindle and A7 memo bottle which are basically must carries for me. \n\nI’ve got a Moment MTW 1L as a pocket emptier which is good for short trips down out the house but I’m looking for something closer to the 3/4L range and something a bit more toward the sachoche style so it can wear it if I’m not dressed as casual. So far that’s the reason I haven’t tried the 6L venture or even the 4L lite sling mini, but I’d definitely consider either if I had the money to spend. \n\nI tried the Bellroy Lite Sachoche which I felt was undersized and really didn’t hold its shape well. Wasn’t for me but I posted thoughts and photos here. https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/UfCtGDPr39 \n\nI’m thinking a bit about the black ember sachoche but want to line up a few other options to compare against before making a purchase.', 'Rocking the 9L here for all use case.', 'Yeah mine are definitely made of metal. Could be the smaller versions. Sometimes I’ve found on Amazon reviews for products get mixed up with others..', 'I constantly compare it to the 6L Venture mostly because of the internal organization (very basic on the Lite) and the lightness being both a blessing (weight) and a curse (feels “floppy” when grabbing it in a rush, especially when the main zip is wide open. I used to have items fall when I first started using it).\n\nAlso, having used an original 7L sling for a few months before the Lite, I learned to appreciate the material of the interior lining on the Lite. The OG/Venture uses materials that feel nicer to the touch, but the Lite feels less prone to stain, which I appreciate when using it while having my hands dirty. I’ve cleaned it up a couple of times, and still looks mint.\n\nOh, and as a leftie, I really miss having the ambidextrous clip. The OG sling was lefties friendly, but the Lite reversed it. \n\nI haven’t been able to decide between the 9L and the 6L. As you said, makes sense for all-day out situations, but might be a tad too much for daily EDC. I might end up waiting to see what Bellroy comes up with next!', 'I personally liked the fabric of the lite better.  The lite has less pockets and organization than the venture, but it felt more comfortable to wear. It drapes on the body better.  \n\nThe fabric of the 2.5 is somewhere in between - it’s a lot lighter than the 6L, but not as light as the lite - a bit stiffer.  I have the 4L also, which I like but doesn’t nearly have the organization of the new one.  However, the 4L will hold a water bottle where the 2.5L won’t.', ' Btw. Tenba sells a universal shoulder pad I plan on getting for my sling. The 9l slings can get heavy. I feel like when fully loaded they benefit from a shoulder pad.', 'Yeah similar to me, I’m using the 9l for my switch and iPad but everyday use it’s a bit bulky. I was looking at the Sachoche as a third option and your write up has eliminated that option. If I get my hands on a lite (which I think it’ll be) I’ll be sure to let you know.', 'I saw packhackers review again. The female part of the buckle is metal but not the male part. That’s causing the issue from other reviewers. \n\nI guess, if u don’t use the buckle much it will hold.\nI‘m thinking to replace it with Fidlock slider, if the strap is not wider than 40mm.', 'Half of it is metal, while the other half is made of plastic. Interestingly, I like the Venture design so much that I would neglect its weak spot of buckle breaking as in trade off.', 'What colour 9L venture sling do you have? that seems to make a difference, as the different colours use different materials.']","[6, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]","['2023-04-02 16:49:10', '2023-04-02 13:56:44', '2023-04-02 19:55:45', '2023-04-02 20:30:41', '2023-04-02 06:45:21', '2024-02-11 13:26:18', '2024-04-28 01:32:01', '2023-06-02 19:07:49', '2023-10-09 17:50:43', '2024-02-13 15:09:54', '2023-04-03 00:43:11', '2023-04-02 23:57:51', '2023-04-03 21:08:12', '2023-04-03 00:52:07', '2023-04-03 00:59:18', '2023-04-02 06:52:12', '2024-04-28 09:59:40', '2024-05-11 18:10:21', '2023-10-12 23:22:32', '2023-04-03 01:07:35', '2023-04-03 03:13:10', '2023-04-02 13:55:50', '2024-04-28 14:05:41', '2023-10-13 11:32:48', '2023-10-20 10:13:59', '2023-10-29 18:13:41']",46,2023-04-02 06:07:39

Bellroy Lite Sling-worn and used!,"I love this thing! It’s 7L capacity is perfect for me. I commute by bike so I don’t carry all my main things on my person, that goes on my bike rack pannier.

It’s showing wear and tear on the chalk color but I honestly don’t mind it. It gives it a used look. The magnetic clasp is so secure. I honestly can’t get it open sometimes. I got caught in a light sprinkle and everything stayed dry as well.

"New Day, New Bag - Bellroy Tokyo Tote v1","Earlier post mentioned a complete u-turn on the Alpha One Niner Whitley after getting it again after 85 weeks.  Here's another u-turn moment for me, this time with the Bellroy Tokyo Tote v1 in 15L.  Have tried a number of totes as my daily and office carry but always end up selling it for some petty reasons.  After seeing another Bellroy Tokyo Tote in marketplace, just couldn't pass on it.  The wide opening, the anti-slip thing on the straps and the internal water compartment is some of the things I really love.  The only gripe I have on this is that the sleeves inside cannot fit a 13"" but only an iPad 11 in vertical mode.  Had the v2 but couldn't remember if that can fit a laptop 13 too.   Any other totes I should try?    Enjoy some moody photos!  
Some of the totes I have tried:

1. MW Drift Tote
2. Alpaka Bravo Tote
3. Bellroy Market Tote
4. Filson Zippered Tote
5. AER Go Tote 2, 
6. Bellroy Tokyo Tote Pack
7. Bellroy Tokyo Tote v2.

Alpaka Go Sling mini vs Bellroy Lite Sling mini?,"Short of ordering both, does anyone have insight or personal experience with Alpaka Go Sling mini vs Bellroy Lite Sling mini?

Also adjusting the length of the straps on Alpaka are f*cking annoying!!!!

This can be a pro or a con. If you like more organisation then Alpaka will serve you better if you just want a dump pocket the bellroy. \n\nIn summary they are both just as good each other apart from the straps being worse on the Alpaka + it remaining more slim on body. \n\nI’d just pick the one you think looks best/functionally serves you well if the cons of each doesn’t bother you.', 'Bellroy has the worst return policy and worst customer service in the game.

So if the weight of your current loadout isn't bothering you on the 9L you might not find much difference, unless you really want the dividers."", ""I'm just gonna butt in here because no one replied to the thread I started on the question: Do y'all know what the major differences are between the Bellroy Lite slings and the Bellroy Venture slings? More padding? Different materials? Different strap? Different organization? Obviously the weights between the two series are different, so I imagine it's the materials. The Lite 7L feels like the perfect sling to me, though I haven't packed it with tons of stuff. I'm just wondering what one gets with the Venture (6L or otherwise) that justifies the huge difference in price.

The lite slings have a thinner material to allow it to be folded up for storing on the go. The ripstop fabric of the venture line not only feels more premium but is also ""tougher"" and more resistant to damage.\n- Different organization. The lite slings have less organisation on the inside. I think the internals are also made of slightly inferior materials. I don\'t recall any of the stretchy nylon pockets on the lite version. \n- strap materials are the same, but buckles are different. Venture series\' buckles are prone to breaking due to metal on plastic, but this shouldn\'t be too much of an issue if you bring the bag over your head instead of detaching the buckles each time. \n\nThe venture series overall has better build and quality, hence the difference in price. They just feel a bit more premium and more comfortable than the lite version. \n\nHope that helps!', 'What new camera sling bags did you move to instead of the bellroy ones?

So about a 27% width increase over the lite\'s strap. \n\nThis probably attributes to the increase in comfort, especially when carrying more gear. On that note, the more rigid material on the venture series allows the sling to hold its shape a lot better than the lite version when fully packed out. More padding = less bits digging into you.', 'What’s the update on the wotancraft?', 'Damn. 1.18"" is just about it, though I measured it at 1.187"".

Difference between Bellroy Lite sling fabric options? (Diamond Ripstop VS Dura Lite Nylon) ,"Hey all, I've been on the hunt for an EDC sling and I really like the design of the Bellroy slings. I've currently got their 2.5L and 6L Venture slings and just picked up the Lite Mini (4L). For me it's the perfect size but I don't love the fabric. It's a little slick, doesn't feel as durable, not a lot of structure etc.

The fabric I got was the on sale version for $49 which is their diamond ripstop. They have a new fabric on their website for the Lite slings called ""Dura Lite Nylon."" zooming way in on the website photos, that nylon looks more matte and more similar to the Venture slings fabric... although obviously not the same.

I'm wondering if anyone has seen / felt both these fabrics in person who can comment? The new fabric is full price at $79 but that's worth it for me if I like the fabric more. Any help is appreciated!

  
EDIT: I bit the bullet and bought the new version as well and I like it!  It's still very lightweight, but much closer in feel to the Venture sling fabrics than the original Diamond Ripstop.  It also features matte reverse coil zippers vs. the shiny aquaguard zippers from before, which I dig as well.

 I made a video comparing the two versions here: [https://youtu.be/\_a0D2cVJ6Xs](https://youtu.be/_a0D2cVJ6Xs)","[""I have the diamond rip stop and so far so good, got it in June and it's holding up fine!"", 'Here\'s their Facebook post about the fabric switch from 6 days ago.

Personal review: Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2 vs. Bellroy Venture Sling 6L,"Okay. I have bought and used both of these bags for about a month. I would like to share my personal opinions about these two bags and also hear your thoughts to find something newer. Here are my opinions:

1. **Bellroy:**
   * **Fabric and Stretch:** The fabric is stretchier and the compartment is larger. This makes it better if you don’t prioritize organization.
   * **Flexibility:** You can flatten or fold the bag. The strap is detachable, allowing it to become a desk bag or be folded compactly in a suitcase.
   * **Compartments**: I really like the front compartment design of the Bellroy, On the outside, it looks like a hidden compartment with the front opening raised to cover the zipper. When you open the bag to get something, only you can see inside, which keeps things more private. On the other hand, the Alpaka’s compartment is more traditional in design. Next, the main compartment is quite spacious but only has one small pocket for storing glasses, separated from the bottom of the bag by a padded layer from the back of the bag (there’s no rear pocket). This is a pretty clever design, and I can fit two of my glasses cases in this pocket. Beside that, it has two additional mini pockets on the sides of the bag, where I can separately store keys or a small hand sanitizer bottle without having to mix them with other items.
   * **Thickness and Padding:** The fabric is thicker with padding on the back, but it lacks compartments.
   * **Strap Quality:** The strap is better with a magnetic clasp for detachment.
   * **No Handle:** The bag does not have a handle, which I find puzzling. It might be due to design aesthetics.
2. **Alpaka:**
   * **Fabric and Structure:** The fabric is thinner but stiffer, making it harder to fold compactly.
   * **Compartments:** It has a back compartment, which is safer for important items like a wallet and phone as it is in contact with your body. The front compartment is used for small items and keys; fitting a smart key is tight, but the back compartment is okay for hand sanitizer, wallet, and phone. Overall, the middle compartment fits my needs but isn’t as comfortable as the Bellroy. In terms of the width of the iPad mini compartment is wide enough to fit only a sunglasses case and a wallet. The four mini pockets in the main compartment are generally okay.
   * **Key Hook:** The key hook has a magnetic clasp, which is easier to remove than Bellroy’s clip. The magnetic hook is nice and of high quality, which I think is a selling point.
   * **Strap Adjustment:** The strap is non-detachable and hard to adjust, with an elastic band to secure the excess strap, which looks untidy. The strap doesn’t grip well and tends to twist.
   * **Water Resistance:** The main advantage is its water resistance with Xpac fabric, whereas Bellroy’s water resistance is not highly rated.
   * **Fidlock V-buckle:** I’m not a fan of the Fidlock as it’s hard to open when wearing the bag. This could be an anti-theft feature.
   * **Accessories**: One more thing I like about the Alpaka is the included accessories. I bought three of their HUB keychains and they are the most useful small things I’ve ever bought..

I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences with these bags or if you have any recommendations for something new.

Bellroy transit workpack 20L vs Evergoods CHZ22 V2,"Kinda torn between both at the moment and hope to get some help. 

Love the CHZ22’s rugged material/cross over bag elements and comfort (straps + back panel) but find the compartments lacking a little. 

On the other hand, I love the transit workpack’s compartments but worry about the durability of the materials and whether it’ll fit in an outdoor setting (think day hikes). 

My EDC (if it matters): 
1. 23Oz water bottle
2. Laptop & folder for A4 papers
3. Tech pouch (wandrd small tech pouch) 
4. First aid kit (Helikon-Tex micro Med kit)
5. lunch box (5 x 5 x 2.5 inch) 
6. foldable umbrella (~7.5 inch) 
7. Other small items such as sanitiser, floss, 6Oz mouthwash, wet wipes, extra masks, etc. (these are currently sitting loose in my current bag’s admin panel, but I can fit them in a pouch). 

Thanks in advance :-)","['if you are into Mystery Ranch, you may wish to take a look at their new District 24 which will be available soon. It’s like a chz with much more organization and flexibility.  The fabric may be less durable but is still 420D cordura, a half pound heavier than chz and looks more casual.\n\n[Mystery Ranch District series](https://youtu.be/4WQVwplBSbI)', ""I have not used either of these bags, so can't compare. But want to throw evergoods [PCL20](https://evergoods.us/products/panel-loader-classic-20l) in for consideration. \nIt is incredibly versatile bag. Almost clam shell zip makes the access super easy.  \nThis bag definitely needs pouches but you seems to already use them .\nYour load will fit with rooms to spare."", 'I rate the Camelbak MULE Commute very highly, this might fit. Great comfort, great materials, stash front pouch (recon style) is great, plus has good positioning on the front and the shoulder straps. Carries very well.', 'Have you looked at the ULA Dragonfly? It’s advertised as a 30L bag, but that includes the external stretchy pockets, while the body of the bag is about 22L.', 'I don’t have the workpack but I have the CHZ22 v2 and I love it. My EDC carry is about the same as you and have found that everything fits in with room to spare (if needed) and is very comfortable. It’s the perfect size backpack for my needs and I love how durable it is.', ""I've tried out 11 different backpacks in the last 2 weeks. \n\nMy top 2 were the Patagonia Black Hole 25L, and the CHZ22. I think I'm honestly going to keep both of them. The CHZ22 is quite honestly as close to zero compromises as I can imagine.\n\nThe Patagonia Blackhole 25L is remarkably functional with similar design in practice to the CHZ22 despite how different they appear at first glance. They both have a large quick access pocket on the top. They both have a flap that you flip down after unzipping to access the cavernous main compartment, also revealing an additional pocket (2 pockets in the case of the CHZ22).\n\nThe main difference between the two, is 1. the aesthetics, and 2. frame vs no frame. This can be either a pro or con to you in both cases. The lack of frame in the patagonia means if you underpack it will fit in small spaces / compress much easier.\n\nI think I'm keeping both of these bags, but if I had to choose just 1, it would be the CHZ22. Mainly because of aesthetics. But I also REALLY LOVE the pocket that causes the dreaded duckbill. There's no pocket in this location on the patagonia, and it's extremely functional."", 'You might want to look at going up to a chz26 if you like the 22 and a bigger bag isn’t an issue for you. The 26L has one additional pocket the 22 doesn’t have.', ""I have the Workpack 20L in black. I like the bag. I HATE the internal water bottle pockets. Also the external material sort of feels like plastic (it is recycled water bottles after all). However I've read that the material varies slightly between colors. I also wish it had internal lash points like the way Tom Bihn does. The AquaGuard zippers are quite shiny, but it's not a big deal. Other than that, it's a nice little bag that does well taking to my office.  \n  \nI have a feeling your water bottle won't fit in the bottle pockets. I have a 16oz Zojirushi that fits but is difficult to get in and out"", '[deleted]', 'I used the Bellroy Transit workpack for 3 month. There are 2 big issues with this bag\n\nThe Straps Slip from the shoulder if the backpack is slightly packed (like under 5 kg)\nThe Straps dont hold there lenght if the pack is a Little Bit More packed\n\nThat is so anoying.

Shall look into the PLC20’s volume; whether it packs close to 20L, or more than that..', 'Wow it’s my first time seeing someone recommend a Camelbak backpack and it really looks decent. No doubt it’s made for cyclists but I can see it being used as an EDC as well. \n\nOne of my personal preference so far is to have a top quick access pocket (which both the transit and CHZ) has. But I’ll keep this in my view if neither works out!', 'I just had a look and the dragonfly seems to have a lot of thought put into its compartments! However something just doesn’t click with me about it.. not sure if it’s the overall design or something else. But thank you for suggesting this bag :-) it’s interesting how it’s rated as 30L but the main body’s internal is 22L.', 'Thanks for the assurance that my items will fit. Can I check if you’re using pouches completely to keep things organised? In my current backpack (Raven 20) I was able to use a mixture of pouches and the bag’s own organisation and I loved that hybrid mode. Could not imagine going all-pouches as there are somethings I hope to have access easier than others (i.e. it’s usually harder to get access to things in pouches, especially while commuting).', 'Thank you for sharing.

How is yours holding up? Also, unfortunately, black is no longer available but there’s a midnight colour way that supposedly “black” but more plastic-y… \n\nNoted on the bottle, it does seem like a tight fit.

I ended up getting the CHZ22 v2, and I constantly find myself wondering if the organisation of the Workpack 20L would’ve suited me better. Sadly, glad to hear that the straps are almost unusable and would have made it difficult for me to use the bag as well.', 'it’s unfortunate…it’s the opposite in my place that, MR is generally available in a number of stores, but the Evergoods are only sold by a sole agent and much more expensive.', ""Plc20 is deceptively cavernous. \nAs an example,Once I was able to pack two mac bookpro(14 and 16 inch) , ipad mini, aer slim techpouch, alpaka hub pouch, 32oz Nalgen, rain jacket, hoodie, phone, wallet, keys and bose qc35 in that. \nIt's very versatile and replaced my edc and urban travel packs."", 'It has a top quick access pocket for small items just like the CHZ and most backpacks', 'As far as I’m aware, that capacity measurement style is actually standard practice for many outdoor-oriented bags.', 'Yes, I do use pouches! While I do miss having an admin pocket/panel (all of my past backpacks were North Face), I’ve found that not having one isn’t a dealbreaker for me. My suggest would be to put the things you don’t need quick access to closer to the bottom, perhaps your lunchbox and umbrella (if you aren’t storing it in one of the water bottle pockets) closer to the bottom of the bag and putting your tech pouch on top of the lunchbox? I have an Aer Cable Kit 2 for my main tech pouch, but if I don’t need everything in it then I’ll store what I need in a smaller pouch, such as my chargers, battery pack and cords in a Topo Designs accessory bag for a flatter footprint.', 'Fun fact, you can remove the frame sheet in the CHZ if you don’t want to use it!', 'Bellroy Classic - Nice materials inside and out, well put together. Lacking organization & didn’t like the front pocket shape and it was hard to see inside. No water bottle pockets. Otherwise a very nice, simple bag.  \n\nTimbuk2 Division Deluxe - way too bulky/heavy for what it could hold. Decided I prefer to have the laptop sleeve in the main compartment. This was my least favorite bag of all (except for the Alpaka).\n\nOsprey Daylite Plus - Excellent daypack, lovely features, very comfortable, but was too outdoorsy oriented for my needs as my goals for this pack is primarily intended to be an EDC office bag.  I didn’t expect there to be so many straps dangling everywhere with no way to control them. The compression straps for the exterior pouch prevent you from unzipping the main compartment by too much.  \n\nOsprey Arcane Large - This bag was a close 3rd place. If you pack with pouches/cubes this bag gives you an absolute ton of space. It packs more like a 25L bag. Extremely light weight at 1lb 6oz. It also simply looks nice on the outside and feels good to the touch. The straps are very comfortable and well built despite lacking a sternum strap. It’s fairly priced at ~$85. I really wanted to like this bag. I just didn’t like the quick access situation, and the inside materials of the bag feel very cheap in contrast to the outside and straps. Also was concerned with how the exterior shell fabric would hold up over time and its water resistance.  If I was limited to a budget under $100, this would be my recommendation. \n\nAlpaka Elements Backpack VX21 LE - This one is pending response from the company. A very strange issue happened with this order and I’d like to give the company a chance to make it right before blasting them publicly from a business standpoint. As for the bag itself, they put too much stock into the Hub system and it’s lacking useful pockets inside and outside. The front exterior pocket is the worst I’ve ever seen. It is tiny, with a small opening, so you can’t see inside well, and it takes space from the main compartment if you manage to fit something inside it. It has no extra fabric to expand as you fill it in either direction. It’s nearly unusable even with the bag empty, with the bag packed it is 100% useless. This leaves you with no quick access pocket at all. A dealbreaker for me. \n\nMountain Hardwear Camp 4 21 & 28 - Laptop sleeve was too tight on both of these. I occasionally carry two 14” laptops, and I could barely squeeze in one of them.  \n\nSwissgear Scansmart 1900 31L - Pockets pockets pockets pockets. It’s too many pockets and it’s too big/heavy of a bag for EDC.  \n\nEvergoods CHZ22 v2 - I really can’t say enough good things about this bag. The fabrics are gorgeous inside and out. It feels absolutely amazing to the touch. Everything seems thoughtfully designed down to the shape of every pocket and how the bag expands as you fill it up. At first it almost seems like it was tailor made for how I pack, but then I can completely change how and what I pack, and the bag just eats it. No matter how full I pack the bag, every pocket remains as functional and accessible as it is with the bag empty. It’s truly a masterpiece in design. If I had to nitpick one thing I dislike about this bag, it would be the fabric on the shoulder straps. It makes a crinkly sound when you touch it, and has less friction than most, which causes it to slide down my shoulders more than other bags. I find myself having to use the sternum strap more often than I’d prefer due to this.  \n\nPatagonia Black Hole 25L - Outdoorsy looks, not great for the office but white people do love Patagonia so it should be OK. Extremely lightweight at 1lb 7oz, losing only to the Osprey’s Arcane Large in this respect. Durable waterproof material for the bag body, though the zippers and some of the seams will let water in if being fully soaked. Lifetime warranty. Nylon webbing down the front which gives you both an additional horizontal grab handle and loops to hang/strap other gear to. Large dual stretch water bottle pockets. Bag is basically just a huge bucket with a huge quick access pocket on top and water bottle pockets. The colorway I have lines the inside with bright yellow making it easy to see all the contents. There is one additional mesh pocket near the top of the bag on the inside. I wish this mesh pocket was a tighter knit mesh to prevent sagging down. I also wish the quick access pocket had a key leash. Despite their fabric feeling and looking kind of cheap, I find the shoulder straps to be extremely comfortable, more than any of the others I’ve tested. It’s a bag. It’s got some compromises but they feel like all the right ones to me.\n\nEdit: 11 days later\n\nThe CHZ22 is so far ahead of every other bag tested as a contender for my EDC bag that it’s 100% not being sent back to Evergoods. \n\nI’m also still currently holding the Patagonia Black Hole 25L. Can’t let this one go for some reason. There’s just something about it that I really like, and the colorway I got was only $129, a really fair price I feel. I like how lightweight and packable it is. Considering keeping it as a packable daypack inside of a larger ~35l or ~45l travel backpack, or for use as a daypack/hiking, as it’s much cheaper and less likely to get damaged while hiking than the Evergoods.\n\nI also just received the Patagonia Mini MLC 26L (2022) yesterday and holy shit. It’s a fantastic travel pack. Like, I cannot imagine a better pack for a week long trip. But the materials just don’t have the premium feel I’m looking for with an EDC pack, and the top quick access pocket sags to an annoying degree when loaded up. This bag holds so much more than 26L namesake suggests. To compare, I can pack for 4 days in the CHZ22. I can pack for 7-10 days with the Mini 26L. I wouldn’t want to use this bag as an EDC but I’m considering keeping as a travel pack, or maybe even getting the full size MLC 45 as a travel pack. I’m not sure it really makes sense to keep both the Evergoods and this one. The straps on this bag are also very uncomfortable on my shoulders when loaded out compared to others I’ve tested. It seems like it’s due to the angle of the straps. They’re almost sewn flat to the bag, and don’t curve to my shoulders well.\n\nMy original goal when I started this journey was to find an EDC bag that while capable of a week long trip, looked appropriate in an office setting and doesn’t sag a ton when lightly packed. There are some other small nitpicks things I’m looking for as well but I’m beginning to wonder if this exists, because I haven’t found it yet. I think onebag life is not possible for me, and I will end up with either 2 or 3 bags.', 'Yeah you’re right they did on the new one, I have a v1. I ended up getting the CPL24v3 for a bit more organization and so it would stand up. I just carry my bottle inside now and it’s worked well so far.', 'Mine is the midnight version. I haven’t had it long - a few months - but durability doesn’t seem like it will be an issue. Overall I still like the bag despite the quirks.', 'What do you find difficult to organize when it comes to the CHZ? I have the bellroy but am considering the chz', 'That’s really quite a fair bit of things that fit! And indeed what a “good time” for me now that the Bellroy transit and CHZ22 are on sale from where I’m at, whereas the PLC20 isn’t…', 'Sheesh can’t believed I missed that in the photos. At any case I have ordered the CHZ22; if things don’t work out I have the camelback to check out :-)', 'Got it! Guess I may really give it a try as I’ve been dying to try out an Evergoods bag! And if I really can’t do without an admin panel I guess I’ll have to sell the bag and stay away from bags without admin panel from here on.. \U0001f972', 'I wish someone would make a video on how to do it. It really doesn’t seem like it wants to come out on my v2 and I’m scared to damage something. Evergoods has stated it’s not intended to be removed.', ""Oh woah, awesome, thanks for this! I was actually looking at some of these myself so super helpful :)\n\n*edit*\n\nAlso is the Evergoods CHZ22 v2 the one with their new backpanel that's supposed to be more breathable? Seems weird that it's so slippery that it slides around like that, kind of a bummer :("", 'Thanks for sharing about this. I am aiming for the midnight or night sky version. Both seems to feel similar. I am quite torn between both still but may go for the Evergoods first and resell it (returning isn’t an option) and get a Bellroy if I really don’t like the Evergoods.\n\nQuestion - do you feel that the straps and back panel are OK? I tried the transit in shop and it felt ok but I worry as the straps seem thin (although reviews seems ok) and back panel doesn’t seem to have ventilation.', 'My previous backpacks all at least have 2 compartments - a front admin section & main compartment. So it’s mostly having to used the main compartment only that’s a challenge initially. \n\nNo doubt there’s a top quick access yoke pocket in the chz22 but I mainly store small items there. It’s amazing though. \n\nI’ve been using the CHZ for about 7 months now? Kind of used to the organisation style overall, although no doubt I still wish it had a zippered compartment on the front of the bag, which would make this bag close to perfect for me!', 'You may surprise yourself! I thought I couldn’t live without one but I’m actually not missing it all that much?', 'Oh oops, maybe I am thinking about the video I saw where Kevin mentioned taking the frame sheet out of the CPL.', 'Yes the v2 has the new back panel. The back panel is fine and I have no complaints, but it would be nice if the frame sheet was more easily removed. The issue with straps sliding down could be due to the shape of my shoulders and vary from person to person, but you will notice the crinkling noise for sure.', 'They are on the thinner side, but I think adequate for the size of the bag', 'Just ordered CHZ22, I guess I’ll find out soon!', 'Happy cake day btw!', 'Thanks my dude. Appreciate your sharing. I have ordered the CHZ22; if things don’t work out I’ll consider the transit again together with some other bags suggested here!', 'How have you found your CHZ22? In terms of comfort and organisation?', ""Hey! It's taking sometime to get to me unfortunately as I ordered from an authorized dealer in South East Asia (and stocks are taking awhile to get to them) but I can drop a reply here once it's here probably next week :-)"", 'Apologies for the super late reply. Bag just got to me yesterday (been 5 weeks.. woah). \n\nHaven’t tried real usage (WFH at the moment) but just loading it up.. comfort is perfect for me (I’m 5’4). \n\nOrganisation wise - pockets and water bottle pocket are really wonderful, but what would make this THE perfect bag for me was if it had a separated front admin panel. \n\nOn a typical EDC there are no issues if bag is up to ~80% full. but if I’m out on a grocery run/travelling and bag is filled to the brim, my concern is getting to those internal organisation pockets without my items spilling out.\n\nEdit: side note are you a Malaysian/Singaporean? u/donliddatsay just realised your Reddit username lol. I’m Singaporean here!\n\nEdit2: I bring my laptop out occasionally/to office and typically only take out my laptop for use in an environment where I can comfortably unpack my bag to access the laptop compartment, hence it being in the main compartment have not been an issue for me in my other bags. I assume it wouldn’t be an issue with the CHZ22 as well.']","[4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]","['2022-09-04 05:52:33', '2022-09-03 17:55:35', '2022-09-03 22:07:55', '2022-09-04 01:07:22', '2022-09-04 01:30:06', '2022-09-04 04:48:29', '2022-09-03 17:06:47', '2022-09-03 20:20:23', '2022-09-03 21:02:16', '2023-06-07 13:03:40', '2022-09-04 08:29:29', '2022-09-03 19:18:47', '2022-09-04 04:20:02', '2022-09-04 04:29:17', '2022-09-04 04:22:01', '2022-09-04 08:28:45', '2022-09-04 07:52:04', '2022-09-03 17:28:51', '2022-09-04 04:10:58', '2022-09-04 04:12:05', '2023-06-08 03:35:37', '2022-09-04 09:38:31', '2022-09-03 20:12:50', '2022-09-04 13:07:10', '2022-09-04 04:33:06', '2022-09-04 04:36:20', '2022-09-04 13:52:45', '2022-09-04 14:40:06', '2022-09-03 17:33:39', '2022-09-04 06:41:40', '2023-06-25 18:47:12', '2022-09-04 04:05:44', '2022-09-04 17:49:51', '2022-09-04 08:25:54', '2022-09-04 18:17:57', '2022-09-04 21:00:08', '2022-09-04 08:27:15', '2023-06-26 02:26:45', '2022-09-04 13:49:38', '2022-09-07 15:55:22', '2022-09-04 21:11:09', '2022-09-04 16:32:23', '2022-09-04 17:49:12', '2022-09-04 17:51:03', '2022-09-04 17:52:16', '2022-09-25 07:31:34', '2022-09-25 09:29:36', '2022-10-19 10:46:43']",20,2022-09-03 11:38:41

New Bellroy slings - Venture 2.5L & Lite mini 4L - review coming,,"[""Here's my initial review of the Bellroy Venture 2.5L vs Lite mini 4L: [Photos for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/ZRwA0dR)Edit: Added more photos.\n\nHere is my loadout, the main goal is to carry minimal gear + occasionally water bottle, for travel and EDC. I care more about functionality, and secondly aesthetics.\n\n* Phone\n* Wallet\n* 500ml/16oz water bottle\n* Passport\n* Earbuds\n* Room for other small items, lip balm hand sanitizer bottle etc\n\n**Similararities**\n\n* Both slings are able to fit the above, and are comfortable to carry.\n* Straps are almost identical, with possibly the lite mini with a slightly thinner strap\n* Both fit a switch with side controls on\n* Bellroy measures their width by the zipper, the actual dimensions are different than listed. Measurements below.\n\n**Venture 2.5L**\n\n* Measures (mm): Listed: 220x150x100 (real: 250x150x100). With the different design, the front pocket has its own depth now (unlike other ventures).\n* Fits all the gear well, but does become too bulky, brick-like. Against the body, it definitely sticks out too much. With a narrow water bottle, this will become less, but I still think the lite would look better\n* Surprisingly the front pocket is still very accessible, and I love the divider.\n* The rugged material of the venture means one-hand zipping is easy\n* For such a small bag, the zipper pulls do seem too big. Plus the exposed front zip means you can see all 3 zippers\n* I don't love the phone sleeve. It is a little loose and takes up a fair amount of space. A thinner one would work better. Also, it would be better if it was slightly raised for easier access\n* The sunglass pocket is a little flappy\n* The back pocket is great and fits your passport or phone (pixel 5)\n* No side gussets, and the zippers don't go as wide as the venture line. This makes access to the main compartment slightly harder\n* Overall, great organisation\n* Looks better when not overpacked\n\n**Lite Mini 4L**\n\n* Meausres (mm): Listed: 200x170x70 (real: 240x175x70)\n* Fits all the gear well, and still remains slim looking\n* Same typical front pocket, not the most usable with the main compartment stuffed. Can still be used for earbuds, lip balm\n* Its lacking organisation, and feels like it needs one more internal pocket for my needs. I may stitch on a mesh pocket as I've seen other redditers do\n* Love love love the gussets on the main compartment, this is probably the best feature\n* The small side pocket in the main compartment is pretty sleek, meaning that something in there could slide out the side gusset, in a not so typical scenario. The bag would have to be upside down, and shaken. I still wouldn't put something valuable in there like earbuds.\n\nNeither sling is perfect, I like the organisation on the venture 2.5L but overall the design of the Lite mini looks better IMO. If hardly carrying anything, the venture 2.5L looks better, but the Lite mini is more versatile and will look good in most situations.\n\nEdit: I have returned the venture 2.5L, and I'll be keeping the lite sling mini. Mainly because it holds a water bottle better."", 'Not much info on these slings atm, I ended up grabbing both, dialling in my usage as a light travel sling. I will be posting my full review and comparison here soon, feel free to ask any questions and I can add it to the review.', 'Do the 4L Ventre sling mini has the sunglasses pocket liké thé 6L and 9L ?', 'I got the lite sling mini as well, I find the staps a bit overkill. They are about twice as thick as the ones from the Aer Go SLing 2. Those are my only gripe.', 'I received the Bellroy Venture Ready Sling 2.5L, after five minutes I sent it back… The bag is well constructed like the Venture 9L that I have, let down is the phone pocket padding takes up space, it’s not needed. This bag is best for minimal EDC. Another note, the sunglasses pocket is not good for sunglasses that do not fold flat like Oakley’s. When filled out the bag does become a brick and is not comfortable to wear. I’m just going to rock my Venture 9L for my EDC, despite being much larger it is much more comfortable, holds all my EDC and I can fit a water bottle in it comfortably. The Lite Mini 4L maybe a better option for those who want a more comfortable bag by the looks for what I have read in the comments.', ""How's the 2.5L as a hip pack?"", 'How is the rigidity of the Venture Ready Sling 2.5L? Does it do a ""lunchbox"" look when placed to the side and a bit towards the front?  \n\n\nAlways been a fan of smaller bags as I don\'t carry a lot with me; but as a small guy with a big tummy, this is my issue with my Alpaka Tech Case Mini. Even if it is not full, it will still retain its boxy look as if i have a hard case to the right of my belly (where I usually place my edc). I\'ve returned to my Arcteryx Mantis 1 for my edc at it does not have a very promiment letter box shape.', '👀 if the lite sling mini disappoints or feels redundant you should see my ISO post in the B/S/T thread', 'So I don’t love the look of the Lite 4L, but definitely don’t want a 2.5 L brick on my back. \n\nI actually think the Mini 4L would have been best for me but it’s leather and I don’t do that so I’m gonna try the City Sling and probably will be perfect. \n\nBut in the 2-3L range, I’m wondering iff the Heimplanet (and XL) would have the same problem that some cited with the Venture 2.5 here? Or is Venture more bricky when full because of the flexible material, while the Heimplanet seems more durable and rugged? \n\nHonestly think I have to buy them all and try.. lol. But I so much appreciate everyone’s input!!', 'Can the very back compartment on the Venture hold a passport?', ""thanks for the photos! I have the lite mini which I will be returning due to quality issue and will get the venture 2.5L instead as I like the look more.. the mini 4L looks more like my wife's purses to me.."", 'Thanks for the review. So hard to find any info/reviews of the sling lite mini. Was wondering whether either could fit a A6 memo bottle?', 'how secure is the fidlock? Does it take some effort to have it come apart?', 'Your updated specs have me reconsidering the Lite. I have a flat Samsonite travel umbrella … 230 x 70 x 40 mm. Would that fit?', 'Hi bro! I have a little question, about the straps. I have the Lite Sling Mini, but I think the straps are a little bit flimsy and very thin, personally I don’t like it, I’m looking to grab the Venture Ready Sling but im wondering about if the straps are just the same of the Lite Sling Mini. I want the black model but I just saw the blue one have a different strap, more like seatbelt finish.', "">Its lacking organisation\n\nAh, this is why I always steer away from the lite, after 5 slings, I just don't need something with minimal organization.\n\nThanks for the review, the 2.5L seems really tempting still for me\n\nI really don't think you should be holding a round bottle in these things. Get something flat and square like a whisky flask. A memobottle or https://gsioutdoors.com/products/boulder-10-flask"", 'Have you tried the regular Sling Mini? I found it hard to access the main compartment with the compression system and the smaller zipper opening.\n\nWonder how the Venture 2.5L compares? Thanks', 'hi, in terms of capacity, can you say the 4L lite sling mini fits more stuff vs 2.5L venture ready sling? i just want to make sure because it looks similar in size on the pics. And does a checkbook of 22cm long fits inside both bags?', 'I also recently bought both.  Personally I am using the lite mini more.', 'The Venture 2.5L does have a sunglass pocket, the lite sling 4L does not.', ""Ah really? Seems pretty thin to me, but I don't have the go sling to compare."", 'Great points, and I agree. For a 2.5L sling it needs to be minimal and compact. The ruggedness is great, but adds to the brickness. The lite mini definitely holds a water bottle better.', ""I'm also curious"", 'Not the best, it doesn\'t get tight enough. It would probably be okay if you\'re 34"" waist and above.', 'Yep the venture is much more rigid, which is kinda nice for one hand zipper pull action. Unfortunately yes, it does become a brick when you fill it, eg drink bottle. I actually took pics of this exact scenario, side view. Will post soon. The lite sling however still looks slim with the same content.', 'It is stiffer and retains its shape yes.  I actually don’t like the stiff fabric which is why I have been using the lite mini more.', 'Haha nice! I can still return it within 30 days, so I should be fine. Would be hard to get it second hand this early in the release!', 'what did you find', 'Yep! See full review', ""Haha yeah it's definitely crossed my mind. This smaller shape is a little better and less purse-like. The venture 2.5 looks more retro, bum bag style. It's a preference for sure"", ""Probably, I don't have that bottle but I put up the measurements so you can check"", ""Yeah no issues. When worn, the weight keeps it from unlocking. It's more of a two hand operation, or one really coordinated action"", 'Happy to help. It should, I just managed to squeeze a 24oz hydroflask in, which is about 245mm tall.', ""Afaik they are the same straps, perhaps the lite mini is slightly thinner. But not significantly different I'm afraid"", ""Yeah seems crazy to me, one-two mesh pockets and it would be a banger. \nAlso I've ordered a military canteen, should be a better fit."", 'I have briefly in the store, the new venture/lite line has much better access. Both are less stiff than the original slings. Plus gussets!', 'Yep the 4L fits more for sure. Not sure about the checkbook, just check it against the dimensions', 'I am definitely leaning more towards the lite, it holds the same amount of gear but conceals it better, looks less bulky, but with a slightly bigger form factor', 'any update?\xa0', 'For reference, that strap is thicker than the straps found on the Lite Tote haha', ""Appreciate the reply.\n\noooooh... it's the fabric itself? not the zippers rigidity forming some sort of unintentional frame?\n\nGiven the scenario I gave (on how I wear my bag), would you then recommend the lite sling mini more?"", 'Heimplanet original was great, but a tiny bit small for me and I preferred others. Great texture and material though! XL was just a giant pocket with minimal organization. Looks good on the outside though!  \n\nI got the Aer City Sling 2, loved it. But it’s kind of long shaped for some people, and not very wide. \n\nI also got the Bellroy Venture Ready 2.5 L and I ended up keeping both. \n\nThis Bellroy is notably smaller which is better for day to day use for me, while the Aer City Sling is more for travel or a long day out, in my eyes. Easily fits a regular size water bottle which is cool, so I can grab that for myself or my dog.', 'I did get the Bellroy Mini sling and liked it but as I mentioned in my original comment it is partially leather so that bothered me because I don’t like buying leather. I didn’t get to use it though, but the size felt kinda like the Aer2, even though technically the Bellroy Mini is bigger? The Aer city 2 is just super sleek looking. Nice bag and I get a lot of compliments on it.', 'I actually had the Lite arrive today. We are very close to their Canadian distribution centre, so items usually arrive in a couple of days. The umbrella fits with a little bit to spare. Normally I’d use my Heimplanet sling, but it’s shape (narrower on the bottom), makes that difficult. The Bellroy, with it’s square shape, makes stowing easier.', 'Thank you 🙏', ""Thanks. Another question - in comparing side by side, does the lite sling mini significantly look bigger than venture ready or they look/feel the same? (what's your take on both sizes?)"", 'It’s both the structure of the bag and the fabric itself.  The zippers also add a decent amount of rigidity.', ""Friend, thank you for responding to this late thread necro lol I'm in the market for a 2-3Lish sling and have been considering all of those so your perspectives are v helpful. Besides the ones you mentioned, have you looked into the [Moment Fanny Sling 2L](https://www.shopmoment.com/products/moment-fanny-sling-2l?variant=47464576155963)? If you have I'd love to hear your thoughts on how it compares to the VRS, I've been between those two for a bit and am having a real hard time deciding since I don't have a way to see either of them in-person 😅"", ""Hey bud, you can refer to the photos and my reviews above, not much more to say about it! \n\nI like the venture ready if you're not carrying much, but the lite sling is more useful at its size since I carry a water bottle. I actually use a mystery ranch forager mini as a daily, and the lite sling for travel (where I carry a bottle)"", 'Hadn’t seen it before. They look very similar but the one you linked seems a bit more versatile and to have more bells and whistles. I do like the VRS but it might be slightly smaller. The good thing is, at least the VRS is available on Amazon. I ordered several and returned the ones I didn’t like. I was ready to return the AER one too if I didn’t love it, but felt it had utility especially for longer day trips or travel.']","[12, 6, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]","['2023-04-21 15:37:00', '2023-04-21 07:33:35', '2023-04-21 08:38:59', '2023-04-21 08:27:03', '2023-04-24 19:52:51', '2023-04-21 07:45:06', '2023-04-21 11:44:37', '2023-04-21 23:51:47', '2023-08-18 02:29:43', '2023-04-21 15:27:27', '2023-04-21 16:47:54', '2023-04-22 07:26:30', '2023-04-25 08:02:06', '2023-04-26 20:50:46', '2023-05-16 18:20:49', '2023-04-21 21:52:17', '2023-04-21 20:02:28', '2023-11-20 18:44:30', '2023-04-21 12:18:24', '2023-04-21 14:15:40', '2023-04-21 14:16:05', '2023-04-25 08:58:57', '2023-04-21 07:57:33', '2023-04-21 14:19:50', '2023-04-21 14:17:13', '2023-04-21 12:20:09', '2023-04-22 01:30:34', '2024-06-10 08:56:48', '2023-04-21 23:05:39', '2023-04-21 23:04:56', '2023-04-22 15:30:15', '2023-04-25 08:59:50', '2023-04-29 01:44:28', '2023-05-17 07:54:43', '2023-04-21 23:01:42', '2023-04-21 23:03:22', '2023-11-20 22:01:53', '2023-04-21 14:15:18', '2024-06-10 08:55:08', '2023-04-21 14:33:13', '2023-04-21 14:08:43', '2024-06-11 04:57:37', '2024-06-11 04:59:48', '2023-04-29 02:03:09', '2023-04-21 23:16:00', '2023-11-21 19:58:39', '2023-04-21 18:35:03', '2024-06-14 08:25:03', '2023-11-25 00:13:12', '2024-06-16 19:24:14']",77,2023-04-21 07:32:13

Bellroy Tokyo work bag vs Crumpler month on month,Does anyone have experience with either of these two messenger bags? Have been considering a backpack but think I'm now leaning towards a messenger bag for my commute into work (and use a separate gym bag). I like the look of Crumpler but will say I am a littke but worried about their quality control since changing owners quite a few times over the past few years. ,"[""> but worried about their quality control since changing owners quite a few times over the past few years.\n\nI think Crumpler is in a good place now. AFAIK the current owners are the original founders. They came back in the bring the brand back to what it was. I'd say the QC is as high as its ever been. Unlike most other manufactuers they actually will repair damaged bags rather than bin and replace - https://www.crumpler.com/pages/repairs\n\nThis is Crumpler Australia btw. The European Crumpler is somehow a separate entity now, and still has the awful rebrand. They also don't repair and don't have the lifetime warranty. \n\nI have the smaller version of the Month On Month called Day By Day and I like it a lot. The lack of internal structure makes it quite comfortable. The foldover top is a bit weird and makes getting into the main compartment a little tedious. Something to think about if you need to access it constantly while wearing it. Compared to the Alpaka Bravo Tote and Porter Operator bags that I also own, the Day By Day is the one I can wear the longest. \n\nIf you do get the Crumpler, make sure you pick a weird colour. That's the rule :P"", ""I've had my day by day (smaller version) for a while now (>18 months) and it's held up very well.\n\nI can fit a small lunch, a water bottle, laptop, charger and a decently large book in there easily.\n\nI personally like the G-Hook closing, it makes it feel like it's a little more secure. But also make sure to attach it to the top part of the bag unless it'll flop around everywhere and be annoying."", 'I got the brace messenger a few weeks ago from their Melbourne store and I like it a lot - it’s built like a tank.

Bellroy Tokyo & Via Work Bags compared.,,"['My never ending tryouts for everyday laptop briefcases for my work commute continues.  Just got the Tokyo Work Bag in and I\'m comparing it to the Bellroy Via Work Bag (formerly the tech briefcase I think?) which I had for awhile.  The Tokyo Bag is a little bit larger all around, though they both have about the same sleeve padded laptop sleeve on the inside, its more than big enough to fit any 16"" or 15.6"" laptop in and out with ease (I have a Lenovo Thinkpad E15 gen4 for reference, fits no problem).  Both have the sleeve suspended from the bottom, but the via may actually suspend the sleeve higher because of its rounded bottom.  The Tokyo does have a flat padded bottom, which actually allows it to stand on its own (if not weight imbalanced by the laptop), the via cannot do that.    \n  \nOverall it feels like the Tokyo is made of slightly nicer to the touch materials.  The via feels smaller and more streamlined and utilitarian in comparison.  The Via has one big external pocket and the Tokyo has one zipper but two seperate external pockets, I think I like the Via\'s single pocket more, I can stick an umbrella or drink in it, keeping the main compartment dry.  The Tokyo does have an external sleeve on the side that can take a shorter umbrella or drink though, and it does have more useful pockets within the main compartment.  The spartan Via only has a sleeve and the sunglass mesh pocket.  I\'ve decided to keep the Tokyo mostly cause of its greater size and color, but mostly because I have a heavier laptop and the slightly more cushy strap (with free floating pad which I prefer) works better for me.    \n  \nIf you are interested I\'m selling my Via, check out my listing on the B/S/T thread and PM me or I also have it for sale on the Nomad Nation store on [District.net](https://district.net/nomads?tab=listings&seller=jonuiuc)   I also have a few other bags I\'ve posted about on sale there: the CT15 v3, CT3, and a Cotopaxi Luzon.

[WTT] Bellroy x Carryology Chimera 6L Sling,"Hey y’all! 

I’m looking to trade my Bellroy Carryology Sling. 

Trade for:

- Trakke Largo Dyneema (special projects)
- Some cool fixed blade knife of similar value

Condition B - In great condition. I’ve used it about 2-3 times with very little in it. Usually just sat in my passenger seat as I ran errands. 

It simply isn’t my style. So I’m looking to see if anyone’s looking to trade for a sling of similar size and value. I’m not necessarily concerned with selling it. I’d rather explore other bags/materials such as the Trakke Largo sling which has been my main bag. 

Ideally, and it’s a stretch, but I missed out on Trakkes recent special projects release and have been looking out for the Trakke Largo Dyneema. If someone does have that bag and would consider trading. Please hit me up lol

"Bag Newbie Looking for a Good Quality Sling Bag in 2024: Chrome, Bellroy, or Other? ","I'm a 6'0"" 143lb male looking for a good quality sling bag based on a brand's quality as of 2024. I worry about the quality because it feels like a lot of users are praising the quality of some bags based on their purchases from many years ago prior to any potential changes in ownership or other factor affecting quality, so I'm hoping people have insight on how some brands are in 2024.

I want something that is around a 9L volume size, can potentially fit a Steam Deck, small umbrella, a couple of water bottles, some food, souvenirs, and maybe a thin jacket (or a hoodie) along with the usual wallet+keys+charger+miscellaneous small things (I'm not necessarily carrying everything listed at once all the time, but would like the possibility of carrying a fair amount of items while remaining sleek). I don't plan on carrying things like an ipad/tablet or a laptop (I have separate bags for those items).

I've been looking at the following:

Chrome Industries Kadet Sling: 9L volume, has some good dimensions, and decent appearance. A lot of people are saying that there's little to no pockets for organization and that your stuff is in one ""big pocket"", no outside pocket for a water bottle, and the front pockets can be too tight when you have other things in the bag. It's currently on sale making it one of the cheapest options at the time of posting.

Bellroy Venture 9L: 9L volume, however, it has smaller dimensions than the Chrome Kadet which tells me the Venture can't carry as much as the Kadet (can someone confirm this?). It does appear to more pockets and compartments than the Kadet implying it can better organize your stuff. The smaller dimensions does make it look more stylish and sleeker than the Kadet. It's currently the second cheapest option based  on a sale at the time of posting.

Alpaka Bravo Sling Max V2: 10L volume with the largest dimensions making it bigger than the Chrome Kadet. It looks to have more pockets and compartments than the Bellroy Venture 9L and allows for better organization, however, looking at the video on their site and reading some of the reviews, despite having more volume and dimensions, it sounds like the overall design actually makes it more restrictive and tighter than the Chrome or Bellroy bags. It does look very nice though and has a lot of frills, but those frills are gimmicks I won't even use.

Aer Day Sling 3 Max: A 6L volume which a couple of users claim to be able to carry more than the Bellroy Venture 9L. From the pictures, it appears to have a lot of pockets and compartments, but could easily end up having the same problem as the Alpaka Bravo Sling Max V2 (overall design wouldn't allow it to carry as much or as easily as the Kadet). The outside design appears fine but it feels like it could very easily get ""fat"" and end up looking and feeling way bulkier than it should. This one is the most expensive in this list.

I'm currently leaning towards the Bellroy because it has a little bit of everything I'm looking for. It does sounds like it has some flaws but it is the closest so far to meeting my needs. Second would be the Chrome Kadet but the lack of any organizing pockets/compartments is a bit of a deterrent. 

What do people think of these bags as they are made in 2024? Could they last for awhile or are they living on old reputation? I know most bags won't last ""forever"" but I want a bag where I won't go ""I just got this a year ago! Why is it so shoddy?!"" especially with the amount of money I'm going to spend. Are there any other bags that people might think are better quality?","['I have both the 6L and 9L Bellroy Venture slings. I love them, but there’s no way the volume measurements are accurate. If I had to guess they’re probably closer to 3L and 6L.', 'You\'re right about the missing pockets and organization of the kadet.\nI bought the internal organizer in order to solve the issue.\nJust let me make a suggestion...\nI have the 3 Kadets: mini, normal and max\nThey are solid, good-looking and spacious.\nI don\'t have any of the other btands you mentioned but i have 2 greenroom136: metrorunner, metromonger and, on production, a totally customised Mission Attachè.\nThe metrorunner (no custom) has become my favourite: lot of pockets and organization, very good-looking (navy blu), front pocket and gold interior.\nThe monger is my go-to when I need my 14"" laptop.\nThe attachè (black VX42) will become my cabin luggage, just to have another option apart from the Kadet Max.\nHope i didn\'t add to much to your choice', 'Have you seen that Chrome sells an organizer insert specifically for the Kadet? It’s an added expense but it might be what you’re looking for.\n\nYou might also want to check out the Patagonia Atom 8L sling. It looks to be about the right size and it has a padded strap, which I think you’ll want with the amount of stuff you want to carry\xa0', 'Greenroom136 metromonger is probably annoption to check out (though metrorunner feels bigger than stated too). I’d also suggest Defy Insidious. I love the Jr version.  All these bags are overbuilt and crazy well made.', 'If you like the Kadet, take a look at the Kargo Loculus. It’s the Kadet with thoughtful organization. Also will say that Greenroom136 makes solid bags just like others have stated.', 'Bellroy looks the best out of all of them in my opinion. Can be dressed up or down. Always have lots of pockets. Strap doesn’t look like a seatbelt. And over all made out of great materials', 'I bought the kadet last year pretty much for the same purpose as you (iPad pro 10.5”, steam deck and battery charger, water bottle, etc. Haven’t been able to use it as much as I thought I would but one thing I found useful was having a smaller pouch for keys, wallet, coins, pen, tide pen to transfer between bags when I didn’t want to bring a 9L and to keep those items from being loose in the kadet.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention before I got the kadet, I got the bravo sling pro (not max) and while it fit the iPad, I couldn’t get the steam deck to fit. Opening was too tight and the material was high quality but too stiff. Held its shape, not flexible, and felt heavy.', 'This. I have the 6L and there’s no way it’s 6L. I absolutely love the look, organization, and comfort though.', 'That seems to be the general consensus and from looking at their dimensions. Otherwise, are they fairly spacious for most things? Quality good and lasting? Comfortable for long hours?', ""How's the internal organizer? Is it stable when placed in the bag? Is it secure? Does it work as well as if those pockets were built in and not a loose attachment?"", ""Yes I took a look at the insert. It's unfortunately out of stock. How does the insert compare to a bag that naturally has those organizers? Because something loose like the Kadet attachment makes it sound like it'll move around too much."", ""I read your breakdown post on the Defy Insidious Jr. I like how big and spacious it is compared to the Bellroy 9L. The price itself is a bit of a deterrent at normal retail price. How's the quality of it though?\n\nI also looked at the Greenroom136 and admittedly I got overwhelmed by what I saw on their site. It's nice that options are there but there's too much for me to parse through and understand (and worry about international shipping) when I just want a bag.

Is the quality any good?"", 'Bellroy and Alpaka over state volume for sure.', 'I’ve owned them for about 6 months and they’ve been great so far. I use the 6L for EDC and the 9L for travel. My favorite thing about them is their ability to expand. They lay flat when they’re not full, but have the ability to expand to fit larger items. They’re very well made and comfortable. My one complaint would be about the durability of the buckles - half is metal and half is plastic. I haven’t personally had any issues with mine, but I’ve seen others post pictures of the plastic side breaking. I generally take the sling off over my head and don’t use the buckles unless I really need to. When I do use them I’m careful not to put too much stress on the plastic piece.', ""It's not perfect obviously but it works... And it makes the Kadet less squashy..."", 'Defy bags are massively overbuilt.  Great quality. I’ve had no issues, no loose threads, no abrasions, just awesomeness.  Maybe the only possible downside is the weight - which is going to be an issue for anything 6L+ IMO.', 'Oh totally! There’s a lot of reviews on YouTube for it. It’s made in Colorado and they have a lifetime warranty on their bags.', ""Interesting. How much expansion does the 9L have? One of the things I kind of like with the Chrome Kadet is that it's a big singular pocket, but it's too lacking at the same time. Does the 9L have a similar carrying capacity when expanded?"", 'Less squashy?', ""The more I look at the Loculus, the more I'm leaning towards it and away from Chrome.
